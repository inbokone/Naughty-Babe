Please tell Kuea too.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,500
I know Kuea is worried about Kondiao.

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,360
But I'll take care of things between Kondiao and me myself.

You don't want Kondiao to know about you from others, do you?

out of your need

72

I did it all because of you.

98
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,210

Its eyes are not bulging at all.

120
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,840
It's just they are big.

Before you lost your memory,

122
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,660
you liked to call it Bulging Eye, too.

123
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,460

Were we close when we were kids?

140
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,900
Why do you ask?

141
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,540
Because you said you remembered me when I was seven.

142
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,660
What do you want to know?

143

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,240
Don't let me down since you've been married.

172
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,990
But...

173
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,580
There's a tiny problem, Boss.

174
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,300
I forgot. Are you worried about your kid?

175
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,210
She's just a baby girl. I won't have time during Christmas.

176
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,750
Boss.

177
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,160
I haven't been on my honeymoon.

178
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,400
Then I'm counting on you, Don.

179
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,790
I'm willing to help.

180
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,080
Don't forget that we can't trust anyone yet.

181
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,900
At this ceremony, Kondiao's safety is the most important.

182
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,900
Yes, Sir.

183
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:56,910
Okay, Boss.

184
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,570
I have something important to tell you.

185
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,050
Mr. Phayak is getting married in three weeks.

186
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,000
Can you tell me

187
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,760
if there's anything else I don't know?

188
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,030
About you, your family, and my family.

189
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,340
[Dad]

190
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,660
[Kondiao]

191
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,060
What's wrong? Why are you calling me today?

192
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,620
Dad. Are you busy? I want to talk to you.

193
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,740
-It's that I...
-We can talk anytime.

194
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,140
We're not in different time zones like when you were in the UK.

195
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,680
Dad.

196
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,740
Why did you send me to the UK?

197
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,570
I wanted to give you the best thing.

198
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,400
At that time, the UK was the best choice.

199
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,830
Whether in terms of chances or connections.

200
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,940
And a sponsor like the Chen family would support you.

201
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,570
Then why did the Chen family help us?

202
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,010
I don't want to talk about it. It's been a long time.

203
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,010
That's right.

204
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,110
That's why I want to know why.

205
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,330
I only knew

206
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,250
you would have a good place to live

207
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,480
and a good school to study at.

208
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,370
That was enough.

209
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,770
I didn't have any more wishes.

210
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,220
I just hoped you could come back after you finished your study

211
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,830
and help the Wongteerawit family. That's all.

212
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,060
How can I help the Wongteerawit family?

213
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,570
When do you want me to come home and help?

214
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,060
Don't bother.

215
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,700
You are helping the family by just staying there.

216
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,390
What do you take me for?

217
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,570
You are happy there, aren't you?

218
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,650
You know nothing.

219
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,880
You and Yi are engaged.

220
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,700
You're part of the Chen family.

221
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,460
What kind of attitude are you still putting on?

222
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,460
Or

223
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,300
did you fight with Yi?

224
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:08,700
He doesn't know.

225
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,690
Tam said you didn't want to help the family.

226
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,410
Did Tam say that?

227
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,310
Are you on the phone?

228
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,310
But I didn't say that.

229
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:17,930
Diao.

230
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,160
Well... Uncle Sathaporn is here to talk to me.

231
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,849
We'll talk later.

232
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,650
I love you.

233
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,710
Were you talking to Diao? Is something wrong?

234
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,550
No, we were just talking about the past.

235
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,230
The past?

236
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,410
Why don't you tell him? Why do you hide from him?

237
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,370
We had a deal that we wouldn't talk about this anymore.

238
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,370
Don't worry about it anymore.

239
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:51,930
Okay.

240
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,010
Well...

241
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,450
Did he tell you about the wedding?

242
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,370
Whose wedding?

243
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:58,570
Oh.

244
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,820
It's Diao and Phayak's.

245
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,670
Is Kondiao getting married?

246
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,170
I didn't know at all.

247
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,050
No wonder.

248
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,670
He called and said something strange.

249
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,520
He was probably too shy to tell me.

250
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,030
You can call him back and talk to him.

251
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,290
It's okay.

252
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,130
Let's talk about our business first.

253
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,040
Are you here

254
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,620
to get the materials for the Formula Racing venue?

255
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:37,870
Thank you.

256
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,050
As for the parts business,

257
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,320
I would like to set it aside for now.

258
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,920
I don't have any money these days.

259
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,920
Then how long do you want to postpone it?

260
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,040
It should be after Diao and Yi's wedding.

261
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,010
But even if they get married,

262
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,040
there's no guarantee that we can get more money from the Chen family.

263
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,230
Unless

264
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,110
we can get more from the engagement agreement.

265
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,170
Of course, we can.

266
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,650
I forgot.

267
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,720
Makorn likes Kondiao very much.

268
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,010
Before they get married,

269
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,010
we must sign a new contract with them.

270
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,370
We need to make clear about the bridal gifts,

271
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,410
especially

272
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,750
the share of the formula racing venue.

273

If possible, don't forget me, your brother.

274

I won't.

We've been through thick and thin together.

276

Anyway, the Wongteerawit family will be thrived again.

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,590
Wait.

339
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,040
Did you go to the hospital?

340
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,310
When did you go?

341
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,480
Mr. Aon.

342
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,090
What's the matter?

343
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,190
When I found out that Yi had a car accident.

344
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,340
But the Chen family didn't allow anyone to visit him.

345
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:44,890
Kim.

346
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,890
I don't know. Uncle, you must help me.

347
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,210
I won't admit that I did it alone.

348
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,130
If you don't help me, I'll tell Dad.

349
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,450
Don't you want to get Wongteerawit?

350
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,480
If you tell your dad, what's your mom going to do? Have you thought about that?

351
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,330
Stay still. Don't panic.
I'll take care of it.

352
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,260
Yi.

353
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:19,840
What's wrong?

354
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,280
I'm not sure

355
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,520
what my dad knows

356
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,770
or what he wants from the Chen family.

357
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,260
To be honest,

358
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:36,900
I can't stand that Wongteerawit benefited from the Chen family in this way.

359
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,120
And I know

360
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,450
your dad and you compromised
because of me.

361
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,470
Diao, what do you know?

362
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,950
Yi, what about you? What do you know?

363
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,960
You don't know anything.
Or are you just pretending?

364
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,890
Your memories are back, right?

365
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:35,600
I want to pretend.

366
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,720
Can you speak louder?

367
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,470
I want to pretend that I don't know anything.

368
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,390
I...

369
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,010
Since when?

370
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,610
Since I woke up.

371
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,960
I really lost my memory.

372
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,220
You said you only remembered me when I was seven.

373
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:30,780
Yes.

374
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,290
I really lost my memory then.

375
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,130
But when I woke up again,
I remembered everything in the past.

376
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,210
It's just that the things that happened the day before waking up

377
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,000
were chaotic.

378
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,360
But I remembered it after a while.

379
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,770
I knew we didn't break off the engagement

380
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,850
and I had never been with anyone else.

381
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,620
And I never wanted you to leave me.

382
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,620
But I almost killed you.

383
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,050
-Diao.
-In your life,

384
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,050
I let this happen.

385
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,940
If you were born without me,

386
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,670
you might be able to live a different life that you want

387
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,840
and you don't have to be restrained by your guilt about the past.

388
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,360
Yi.

389
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,340
Let's not get married.

390
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,480
Diao, no.

391
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,530
Or do you still want to go to Switzerland?

392
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,820
It has nothing to do with that.

393
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,190
I don't know. Wherever you go, I'll follow you.

394
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,970
I won't let you leave me again.

395
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,670
Please.

396
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,410
It was my fault all this time.

397
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:02,710
I didn't want to tell you

398
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,110
how I feel.

399
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,710
But now I'm willing to.

400
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,190
Diao, don't leave again.

401
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,380
But if that's the case,

402
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,590
we'll always be trapped in this situation.

403
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,980
I really don't want to stay here like this anymore.

404
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,040
Diao. What do you want me to do?

405
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,320
As long as you tell me,

406
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,640
I'll do everything for you.

407
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,990
Yi. Do you trust me?

408
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,280
Then let's

409
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,040
ruin our wedding, okay?

410
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,390
Aren't you too late?

411
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,820
You just got the car's examination report.

412
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,840
Yi, your car fell over.

413
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:57,060
You almost died, yet you're still so slow.

414
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,070
I'll take care of it.

415
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,860
I'll take care of it.

416
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,380
Dad, why are you worried? I can handle it myself.

417
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,280
If you had solved it from the start,

418
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:08,310
this wouldn't have happened.

419
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,190
What?

420
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,260
Your car was parked at home, but you let someone else tamper with it.

421
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,060
You made a mistake this time.

422
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,780
I'm good enough that I didn't kick you out of our family business.

423
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,220
Hey, give it to your boss

424
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,060
to see if there's anything in common.

425
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:39,710
Diao.

426
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,380
Is there any other car at home under Diao's name?

427
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,940
No.

428
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,510
This is the only one under Mr. Tacha's name.

429
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,220
What about the usage record?

430
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,730
Mr. Tacha only used it when Lian drove.

431
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,590
It's recorded that
Mr. Tacha's driving coach said Mr. Tacha was afraid to drive

432
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,300
because cars went fast.

433
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,710
So when he went out, he would ride a bike

434
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,760
or take a BTS.

435
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,790
Diao is fine

436
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,870
because he rode a bike instead of driving the car I bought.

437
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,530
You really take good care of Diao.

438
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,610
Who else knows

439
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,610
that car belongs to Diao?

440
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,100
Only us.

441
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:35,969
And Wongteerawit.

442
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:47,500
[Wongteerawit]

443
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,500
Why did the Chen family help us?

444
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,350
That's why I want to know why you did that.

445
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,160
What can I do to help Wongteerawit?

446
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,120
What do you take me for?

447
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,060
[Son. Why didn't you tell me that you were going to get married?]

448
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:47,900
Aon.

449
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,100
Go check everything immediately.

450
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,620
The car remains, the CCTV cameras at home, the exhibition hall, and the factory which helped with the registration,

451
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,930
including people related to these documents.

452
00:35:59,120 --> 00:35:59,610
Yes, Boss.

453
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,630
Dad.

454
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,050
I'll handle this myself.

455
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,540
Their target is not me,

456
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,700
but Diao.

457
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:18,580
You know what? The problem now is not only personal damage and property loss.

458
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:23,160
What matters is they want Diao's life.

459
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,000
Yi.

460
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,510
Everything I have is yours.

461
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,970
If it helps you, you should use it.

462
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,110
I've raised you to be wise, strong, respectful, and dignified.

463
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,760
I didn't raise you to be stupid, rigid, and don't show your weakness, you know?

464
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,890
I'll give you time until the wedding day.

465
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,890
Find out who did this. I'll take care of the rest.

466
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,600
And take care of Diao for me.

467
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,440
If anything happens to Diao this time, even if it's a little toe,

468
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,780
I'll kick you out of the Chen family. Go!

469
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:21,590
Dad.

470
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,510
Or should I let Diao go?

471
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,000
Yi, do you want to live a life like mine?

472
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:29,830
If you were willing to let Mom go,

473
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,490
I think I can bear letting Diao go.

474
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,620
I didn't let her go. She left on her own.

475
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,030
She didn't love me anymore.

476
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,790
Yi. You can live like me.

477
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:50,580
When there's a chance, do whatever you can.

478
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,780
If you love someone,

479
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,250
you should let him know.

480
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,160
-But I've made many mistakes.
-You've grown up.

481
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,160
Be confident.

482
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,070
Son, I'm proud of you.

483
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,970
There's only one thing left,

484
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,010
which is I can only close my eyes

485
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,230
after I see your wish come true.

486
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,230
Then don't die.

487
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:21,340
If you die now, I will...

488
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,670
Brat.

489
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,660
Kondiao doesn't want to marry me.

490
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,250
Brat. Get out of my house!
Go.

491
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,810
Don't come back.

492
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,540
What happened between you and your dad?

493
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,150
Nothing.

494
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:49,010
Dad was just afraid that I wouldn't marry Diao.

495
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,080
Then why did you come to me?

496
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,140
Wongteerawit didn't want to kill me.

497
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,030
He wanted to kill Diao.

498
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,410
What did Diao say?

499
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:16,880
Diao doesn't know yet.

500
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,770
You're hiding it from him again.

501
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,510
I don't know what to say.
It could be someone else.

502
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,690
His stepmother, half-brother or sister.

503
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,610
But if they are all Diao's father's children...

504
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,320
Diao will find out eventually.

505
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,640
I just don't want Diao to be disappointed anymore.

506
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,950
Yi, no matter what, you can't stop Diao from finding out the truth.

507
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,150
Besides,

508
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,430
Kondiao is not that fragile.

509
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:46,110
He can even defeat me.

510
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,110
Uh.

511
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,980
I just want to handle everything well before telling him.

512
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,830
If he comes up with something, and asks me,

513
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,050
just like when he ran away to Switzerland, that'll be a big problem.

514
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,640
I just want Diao to focus on ruining our wedding.

515
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,350
Ruin the wedding?

516
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:09,350
Your wedding with Kondiao?

517
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,780
Yes, my wedding with Diao.

518
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,160
Kondiao.

519
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,480
Do you need me to drive you home? You can put your bike in my car.

520
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,250
No, thanks.

521
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,270
I can ride my bike back.

522
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,070
But

523
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,880
it's dangerous for you to drive like this.

524
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,320
You can go back now.

525
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,430
But...

526
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:19,040
-I'm worried about you.
-Don't worry.

527
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,730
I can take care of myself.

528
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,530
Be careful on your way back.

[Standby]

530
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,190
This one follows me.

531
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,000
That one also follows me.

532
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,620
What a tight schedule.

533
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:08,870
Boss. I think Mr. Tacha already noticed. He left by bike.

534
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:15,580
Why do you come back so late?

535
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:19,810
The father of the kid I teach taekwondo followed me.

536
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,420
Is he chasing you?

537
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,420
I don't know.

538
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,250
Then you have to say no right away. What if he becomes a stalker?

539
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,870
I remember that Yi also sent a bodyguard to follow me.

540
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:33,960
Why?

541
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,900
Wait, Yi is calling.

542
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,920
Hello, Yi.

543
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,350
Hello, Kondiao. Where are you? What are you doing? Why didn't you pick up the phone?

544
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,450
I told you to tell me where you would go.

545
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,320
Wait, I couldn't catch them in time.

546
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,170
I'm worried about you.

547
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm fine.

548
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,930
Let me see what you look like when you're worried.

549
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,090
Can you see me clearly?

550
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,300
Where are you now?

551
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,520
I'm at Kuea's house. I'm with Kuea.

552
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:23,960
Yes, Yi.

553
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:26,640
Don't worry about Kondiao. I'll take care of him.

554
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,040
Diao, I'll be late tonight.

555
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,040
I'm here to talk to Lian.

556
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:32,350
What is it?

557
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,770
You can go home to Kondiao.
I want to go home now.

558
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,850
I miss Kuea.

559
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:39,310
I miss you too.

560
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,190
Kuea.

561
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:43,190
I miss you too.

562
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,690
Enough. Go elsewhere and say that you miss him. I want to talk to Diao.

563
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,840
Yi. Anything else?

564
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,640
I'll pick you up two hours later. Is it okay?

565
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,330
I can go home by myself.

566
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,040
No, it's late and dangerous.

567
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,600
Let me pick you up.

568
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,730
You can ask someone to pick me up.

569
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,770
Sleep here tonight, Kondiao.

570
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,140
I don't permit it. See you at home. Diao.

571
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:27,740
Okay, Yi.

572
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,740
Have a good talk with Lian.

573
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,570
See you at home. Yi.

574
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:34,220
Bye.

575
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,040
Yi.

576
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,550
No matter what, you will marry Kondiao, right?

577
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:57,650
Yes.

578
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,290
Kuea.

579
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,630
I need your help.

580
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:08,000
Why don't you oppose him?

581
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,130
Do you think I won't?

582
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,930
You were willing to be the victim

583
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,450
and asked Wongteerawit to make it up to you

584
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,880
because Kondiao wanted to cancel the wedding?

585
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,530
Yes.

586
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:27,430
Are you serious?

587
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,050
Yes.

588
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,410
I wasn't so sure before.

589
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:35,450
Hide.

590
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,840
I don't care where I go. I'll just hide for a while.

591
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:40,930
Let them see me as a loser.

592
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:43,690
You, loser?

593
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:48,170
Are you sure you won't regret it?

594
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,470
It's fun.

595
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,940
Kuea doesn't like you either.

596
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,090
Never.

597
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,910
You must get married. Don't hold onto any lucky thoughts anymore.

598
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,950
My groomsman attire is ready.

599
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:05,300
Protect Kuea. Because no matter what happens to Diao,

600
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,000
Kuea Keerati is involved.

601
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,410
I'll do my best to help you.

602
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,290
Deal. As your friend, I will always say yes to you.

[Work: Bam Bam]

605
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,880
Has Kondiao ever complained to you or discussed wedding matters with you?

606
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,200
Did Yi ask you to find out?

607
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,700
I don't think you can avoid it no matter what.

608
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:01,010
Why do you want to ruin your own wedding?

-I want to fight, but I don't know who the enemy is.
-Coach, you don't seem happy.

if you feel depressed,

just walk out.

613

It's all because of that, right?

614
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,050
That matter has linked our two families.

everyone uses Diao as a condition.

let's play every scene well.
