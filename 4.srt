[Previously]

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,640
You said it yourself. You'll break up with me after getting discharged from the hospital.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,520
When did I promise you that we'll break up?

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,180
Where's the evidence? Any document?

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,780
It seems that Yi has become a different person

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,570
since he lost his memories.

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,820
Now,

10
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,660
he is warmer than a microwave oven.

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,840
You look fine.

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,940
What did you do to dissatisfy Diao?

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,090
I don't know. I've lost my memories.

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,150
You can't fool me.

15
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,550
It's fine that you don't have to believe that I've really lost my memories.

16
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:35,330
I will use my amnesia

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,960
to find out the truth.

18
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,380
Bulging Eye, I'll catch you to make box meatballs later.

19
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,380
Why do you like to scare it like that?

20
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,240
Even when you have amnesia...

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,420
Or...

[Naughty Babe]

24
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,280
You're all here.

25
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,740
Lian.

26
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,410
What's wrong with you?

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,510
What's with Kondiao and Kuea's looks?

28
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,300
What did you do to them?

29
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,760
What did you do to them?

30
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:29,930
Lian.

31
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,480
The Red Team is Lian Kilen Wang.

32
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,850
His opponent is the Blue Team: Yi Phayak Chatdecha Chen.

33
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:58,700
Attack!

34
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,880
Lian, go!

35
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,750
Attack!

36
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,310
Fight.

37
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,380
Time's up. Pause.

38
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,640
Let go first.

39
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,890
The first round is over.

40
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:51,990
Please.

41
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,570
Don't quarrel first.

42
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,600
Look at what he did.

43
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,930
Yi hit me first.

44
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,460
You two, enough.

45
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,460
Yi hasn't recovered yet.

46
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,920
You shouldn't have stopped them.

47
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,840
Why did you hit me?

48
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,000
Yi Yinyin Anan.

49
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,010
Is Yi crazy?

50
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,370
Yi.

51
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,790
Chatdecha.

52
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,810
Chatchata.

53
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,400
Chatchanok.

54
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,940
Yinyin Anan is my little sister.

55
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,450
Yinyin

56
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,820
Anan

57
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,220
YiYi?

58
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,390
Yes.

59
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,020
But you're the only son.

60
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,310
But my mom remarried.

61
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,990
She didn't use the surname of Chen.

62
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,270
But she's still my mom.

63
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,210
My mom's daughter is my little sister.

64
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,830
Yi.

65
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,510
I knew it.

66
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,700
-I'm sorry. Yi.
-Good.

67
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,640
I was too worried about my friend.

68
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,420
Sorry, Yi. I misunderstood you.

69
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,130
Kondiao, I'm sorry.

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,720
It's okay.

71
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,790
Just ask me if there is anything you want to know in the future.

72
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,390
Don't trust Lian for everything.

73
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,070
Kuea asked me if you are close.

74
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,409
What did I say wrong?

75
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,240
Lian,

76
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,450
Yi hasn't recovered yet.

77
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,170
Apologize to him.

78
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,070
Hm.

79
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:43,770
Sorry.

80
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,220
Yi.

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,010
I'm really sorry.

82
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,390
I'm begging you.

83
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,960
Please tell Kuea.

84
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,880
I know Kuea is worried about Kondiao.

85
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,590
And you are worried about me.

86
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,480
But I'll take care of the things

87
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,850
between Kondiao and me on my own.

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,560
Don't tell anyone about what we've agreed on.

89
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,770
Yi,

90
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,710
please take good care of Kondiao.

91
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,770
Don't scold him.

92
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,360
Let's go, Diao. Let's go home.

93
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,430
Diao,

94
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,559
if you want to know anything in the future, just ask me.

95
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,980
No need to ask others.

96
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,580
There's something I didn't tell you.

97
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,420
Because it's about my dad.

98
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,350
Do you miss your mom?

99
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,060
After my parents divorced,

100
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,650
I can only see my mom twice or three times a month.

101
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,950
With my dad's permission.

102
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,660
My dad is worried about the custody.

103
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,130
That old man doesn't even have time to eat with me.

104
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,280
He doesn't even remember my birthday.

105
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,010
Are you mad at your parents?

106
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,180
I was angry at first.

107
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,040
But I understand.

108
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,570
My dad is busy with work.

109
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,160
He doesn't have much time.

110
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,860
As for my mom,

111
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,930
she remarried and has a new family.

112
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,160
So now I want to fulfill my duty

113
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,890
as a son and a brother.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,640
You must love your mother and little sister, right?

115
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,730
Even though you've lost your memories,

116
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,210
you still remember things about your mother and little sister.

117
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,720
I guess so.

118
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,830
My parents divorced when I started to remember things.

119
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,550
I must have hidden them in my heart.

120
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,520
I have never forgotten them.

121
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,790
But your dad loves you too.

122
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,690
When you were hospitalized,

123
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,820
he was worried about you.

124
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,070
This is what members of the Chen family are like.

125
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,900
Like what?

126
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,420
We don't show our feelings.

127
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,160
Diao,

128
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,640
that's why

129
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,850
it hasn't been easy for you all this time, right?

130
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,360
I'm just not sure

131
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,230
if I'm important to you.

132
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,830
If

133
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,700
you have your memories back

134
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,290
and you remember you don't love me,

135
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,860
will you still be with me?

136
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,460
What if I can never have my memories back?

137
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,100
Will you be with me forever?

138
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,860
If I say

139
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,870
I want to keep loving you,

140
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,790
can I do that?

141
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,230
I love you.

142
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,620
How can I be sure

143
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,340
you love me?

144
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,720
-Because you've lost your memories.
-Diao.

145
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:57,040
Our memories depend on our brains.

146
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,890
But feelings

147
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,990
depend on our hearts.

148
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,720
This is the information on the investment projects involving Chen's.

149
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,760
As for this bottle of red wine,

150
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,500
it's from Mr. Lian.

151
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,210
Thank you.

152
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,380
Hm.

153
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,960
Mr. Phayak has seen the information on the investment projects involving Chen's.

154
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:46,960
Yes.

155
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,080
The investment projects involving Chen's.

156
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,820
And Wongteerawit's.

157
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,050
What is Yi doing now?

158
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm going to find Yi.

159
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,670
I'll come back to you soon.

160
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,310
You're not lonely. I'll be right back.

161
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,050
Have you received the red wine I gave you?

162
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:46,700
Yes.

163
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,820
My gift as an apology.

164
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,480
I'm sorry about yesterday.

165
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,110
You already apologized yesterday.

166
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,950
Did you tell Kondiao about everything?

167
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,020
Especially about you pretending to have amnesia.

168
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:04,609
Not yet.

169
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,750
You said you'd take care of it, right?

170
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,380
This is not the right time.

171
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,300
Yi,

172
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,359
you're at a disadvantage now.

173
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,550
I know.

174
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,589
-But I...
-It's time to tell Kondiao the truth.

175
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,900
You don't like Kondiao to hear about you from others.

176
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,300
Maybe Kondiao thinks the same way.

177
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,040
Give me some more time.

178
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,630
Bye.

179
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,690
Yi, are you busy?

180
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,040
No.

181
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,200
Where is Aon?

182
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,620
Nobody told me you were coming.

183
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,410
I didn't tell anyone.

184
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,320
I just want to see if you're okay.

185
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,520
It still hurts a little.

186
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,090
It still hurts? Then why don't you take a break?

187
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,250
You've lost your memories.

188
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,520
Can you work now?

189
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,730
I have to.

190
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,620
My dad and I are not the only ones in Chen's.

191
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,440
Even though I don't remember,

192
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,830
I have to do it.

193
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,290
You're so stubborn.

194
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,290
Who's the stubborn one?

195
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,020
Huh?

196
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,180
You mean Nong?

197
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,490
Nong is not stubborn.

198
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,750
It's waiting for me to go home.

199
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,030
It's neither stubborn nor naughty. It didn't go anywhere.

200
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,470
The car for the VVIP is here.

201
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:38,370
Okay.

202
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,110
I'll go there later.

203
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,880
Diao,

204
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,140
come work with me.

205
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll only hinder you.

206
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,010
Why would you think like that?

207
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,230
Well,

208
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,190
you haven't taken me with you before.

209
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,000
So I don't think

210
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,540
it's suitable.

211
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,510
It's not that.

212
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,080
I just didn't want to trouble you.

213
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,180
What do you think?

214
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:24,540
Are you going?

215
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,750
Aren't you here to see if I'm okay?

216
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,080
I can really go, right?

217
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,540
Sure.

218
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,590
Tell me if you don't like it.

219
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,280
I want to go.

220
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:42,970
Then go get changed.

221
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,320
Okay. Yi.

222
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,100
Three to 74 cars.

223
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,920
Okay.

224
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,780
This is the total number.

225
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,970
This is the total number of this month, right?

226
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,220
Yes, yes.

227
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,280
Okay, I'll take care of it.

228
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,710
Sorry.

229
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,200
Okay.

230
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,570
Hello.

231
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,810
Change this part later. Let me know if anything happens.

232
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,110
Okay.

233
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,580
As usual.

234
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,570
You handle it.

235
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,020
Yes, Boss.

236
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,070
Let's go.

237
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,240
Okay, Yi.

238
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,700
Let's go.

239
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,050
Okay.

240
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,450
Are you tired of it?

241
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,530
No, Yi.

242
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,760
Then

243
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,870
where are we going during the daytime?

244
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,950
Delivering the car to the client

245
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,830
and driving a car to follow it.

246
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,450
Do you have to go in person?

247
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:38,830
Yes.

248
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,110
If it's a collection car,

249
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,470
not a super sports car assembled in Thailand,

250
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,250
I'll take responsibility if anything goes wrong in the early stage.

251
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,590
Chen's has been recognized by others

252
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:51,170
because it considers everything for clients

253
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,430
perfectly.

254
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,730
T&P.

255
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,330
Tacha and Phayak, right?

256
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,320
Yes.

257
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,640
This is customized for our engagement.

258
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,860
There are only two pieces.

259
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,060
Well,

260
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,150
it's quite romantic.

261
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,850
Really?

262
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,670
I didn't notice it.

263
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,780
Next time, remove it first.

264
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,700
Okay, Yi.

265
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,740
You like to tease people.

266
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,750
What did I do?

267
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,940
It's all your fault.

268
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,700
Yes, I am here.

269
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,110
Yes.

270
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,930
So... Yeah, today we have a meeting.

271
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,790
Yes, Thursday.

272
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,490
I heard you had a car accident and just got discharged.

273
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,820
And you came to deliver the car personally. I feel guilty.

274
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,440
I've recovered.

275
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,220
You're an important client of Chen's.

276
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,490
How can I not come in person?

277
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,340
Dad, they collided.

278
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,770
Then don't run, kid.

279
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,470
Mr. Kondiao.

280
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,910
Mr. Kondiao.

281
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,230
Hello, Mr. Chian.

282
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,460
Hello.

283
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,950
Hello, Chun.

284
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,520
Dad, did you ask Mr. Kondiao to see me?

285
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,560
Has Mr. Kondiao already returned from Switzerland?

286
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,920
This is for you.

287
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,800
Thank you.

288
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,120
Mr. Kondiao,

289
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:42,530
I miss you every day.

290
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,680
Dad told me

291
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,570
he would take me to Switzerland to find you.

292
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,070
Son, Switzerland.

293
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,030
Do you know each other?

294
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,190
You even know he's going to Switzerland?

295
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,350
Kondiao is my son's taekwondo coach.

296
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,840
My son likes Mr. Kondiao very much.

297
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,330
Anyway,

298
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,090
thank you for the high-quality services you've been providing.

299
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:19,910
Okay.

300
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,420
Mr. Kondiao,

301
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,880
can you move in to live with me?

302
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,700
I want to see you every day.

303
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,340
I can't.

304
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,600
By the way,

305
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,980
since Mr. Kondiao didn't go to Switzerland, where do you live now?

306
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,980
Are you working for the Chen family?

307
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,600
Do you still live at the same place?

308
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,390
The place where the house owner wants to kick you out.

309
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,820
Is that true?

310
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,190
Actually, it was a misunderstanding.

311
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,170
Well.

312
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,120
I want to invite Mr. Kondiao to move to the apartment I bought.

313
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,230
I mean it. Don't stand on ceremony.

314
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,660
And the apartment is close to my company.

315
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,230
I can ask you to help take care of my son when I get off work.

316
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,000
Mr. Chian.

317
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,160
Don't bother, Mr. Chian.

318
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,430
I can take care of my own man myself.

319
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,980
The Chen family

320
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,800
is really good at taking care of employees.

321
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,190
Thoroughly.

322
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,640
I promise

323
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,220
Mr. Yi won't be disappointed.

324
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,720
He may be small,

325
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,210
but he's very diligent.

326
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,050
I have to pick up my son every day.

327
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,780
So I saw Mr. Kondiao ride a bike to teach kids.

328
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,210
Sometimes when he had a tire burst, he had to wheel the bike.

329
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,710
Can Mr. Kondiao stay and play with me?

330
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,180
I have a car toy.

331
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,140
Yes, stay and eat together.

332
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:01,980
Join us too, Mr. Yi.

333
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,380
It's not very convenient.

334
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,530
Yi.

335
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,760
I don't think you know Kondiao well enough.

336
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,760
Let me introduce him to you first.

337
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,680
This is Kondiao Tacha Wongteerawit. We're engaged.

338
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,930
And we'll get married soon.

339
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,330
Mr. Chian, thank you for supporting the Chen family all this time.

340
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,110
This is

341
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,260
a membership card.

342
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,200
Engaged?

343
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,330
So you're not married.

344
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,920
Soon.

345
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,990
Then I'm taking this opportunity to invite Mr. Chian.

346
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,450
Excuse me.

347
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,480
Bye.

348
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,120
Bye.

349
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,620
-Yi, about Mr. Chian...
-Leave me alone.

350
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,600
It's okay if you don't want to talk to me now.

351
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,080
But you haven't eaten yet.

352
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,530
I'm not mad at you.

353
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,480
I just don't like it

354
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,390
if they know something that I don't know about you.

355
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,500
I still have amnesia.

356
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,480
I love you.

357
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,560
How can you be sure

358
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,310
you love me?

359
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,290
Wow.

360
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,290
The price is 60 million baht.

361
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,060
Is this a car or an airplane?

362
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,700
Why is it so expensive?

363
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:46,430
Dad.

364
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,210
Why didn't you answer my call?

365
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,610
Dad, I'm sorry.

366
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,130
Hello.

367
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,140
Hello.

368
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,140
Please have a seat.

369
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,440
Thank you.

370
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,530
Kondiao has been busy taking care of me.

371
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,200
I don't think he'll have much free time anymore.

372
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,940
Oh. That's great. You should help each other.

373
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,160
I heard about your accident. I was worried about you.

374
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,180
I called Kondiao because I wanted to check on you.

375
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,480
Tem is about to graduate this semester.

376
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,300
He is very interested in cars.

377
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,450
So I want to introduce him

378
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,030
to help Mr. Yi.

379
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,190
Car maintenance.

380
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,520
I just read the report.

381
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,170
The car maintenance business he's responsible for

382
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,080
didn't make any profits last year.

383
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,100
Small enterprises are not doing well.

384
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,670
Right, Tem?

385
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,650
Even my nail salon with Tam

386
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,650
is not doing well either.

387
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,830
Yes, I think we should find a new place.

388
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,460
Actually, I want to do a bigger business.

389
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,290
Car maintenance is just a small business.

390
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,420
I don't have plans to recruit more people.

391
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,920
I'm planning to lay off some workers.

392
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,910
Oh, really?

393
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,120
I still hope you can take care of these younger men.

394
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:49,870
Kondiao too. Help Mr. Yi with his work.

395
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,470
If you need any help from me and your brother, don't hesitate to let us know.

396
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,880
Okay, Dad.

397
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,660
Excuse me.

398
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,160
Mr. Phayak needs to attend a meeting in 5 minutes.

399
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,260
Oh, you have something to do, right?

400
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,040
We can eat together when Mr. Yi gets better.

401
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:18,010
I've made a block booking to throw a birthday party at Pentagon.

402
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,440
Kondiao, take Yi with you.

403
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,090
My friends want to see Yi.

404
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,470
-Tam. I think...
-It's not convenient.

405
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,000
I haven't fully recovered. I don't want to go.

406
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,050
Yi, you said you'd give me a sports car.

407
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,310
When can I receive it?

408
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,280
Let me know when you're going to give it to me.

409
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:17,630
I'm sorry.

410
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,100
For what?

411
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,060
Everything,

412
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,810
including my family

413
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,159
and my misunderstanding of you.

414
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,090
I understand.

415
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:47,080
I understand why you don't want to live with me.

416
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,969
If you still want to run away from me, I won't blame you.

417
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,420
As long as it can make you feel better.

418
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,010
Yi.

419
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,670
You can have that thought.

420
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,130
I understand.

421
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,460
But it doesn't mean I'm not upset

422
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,540
to see you leave.

423
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,220
Let's get married.

424
00:35:58,450 --> 00:35:59,730
Mr. Tacha Wongteerawit.

425
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,790
Let's get married.

426
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,540
[Wongteerawit]

427
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,450
I think your precious son won't listen to us anymore.

428
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,110
He didn't react and didn't help at all.

429
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,120
That's right. I guess Kondiao doesn't want Yi to come to my birthday party.

430
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,630
Hey, Tam.

431
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,610
We went there without making an appointment. Kondiao might be scared.

432
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,410
Right, Dad?

433
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,830
Some of the land of the Formula Racing Circuit

434
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,080
still belongs to us.

435
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,170
Kondiao is still with Yi.

436
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,680
He will help us no matter what.

437
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,530
Taking Kondiao as a hostage is useless.

438
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,870
Nothing can be easily obtained.

439
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,570
The heir of the family had an accident.

440
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,730
They must be more cautious.

441
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,320
Luckily, he's not dead.

442
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,270
Otherwise, Kondiao couldn't get anything.

443
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:44,240
Actually, they should have married three years ago.

444
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,310
And we could have been able to enjoy our lives long ago.

445
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,960
I wonder what they are waiting for.

446
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,280
Not necessarily.

447
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,570
I don't know what tricks the Chen family will play.

448
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,410
Besides,

449
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,890
your husband once said

450
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:01,830
Kondiao will inherit half of the Wongteerawit family's land and all of the family's property.

451
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,690
That's good.

452
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,050
We still have time.

453
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,850
Half?

454
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,520
No way.

455
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,760
Tem and Tam are also members of the Wongteerawit family.

456
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,860
That's right.

457
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,040
If it were you, what would you do?

458
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,550
But if it were me,

459
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,630
I wouldn't care about the Wongteerawit family's property.

460
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,340
I have a bigger goal.

461
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,940
Thank you.

462
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,350
For what?

463
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,390
Thank you for not abandoning me.

464
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,570
When I wake up,

465
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,950
will you disappear?

466
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,050
Why are you asking that?

467
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:38,290
Hm?

468
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,900
I didn't expect

469
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,210
that we could really be together.

470
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:57,630
I'm here.

471
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,630
Come and sleep here.

472
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,340
Since you came back to live here,

473
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,530
I've slept well every night.

474
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,300
You didn't sleep well?

475
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,690
I often had nightmares.

476
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,040
What nightmares?

477
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,010
I dreamed of a tiger.

478
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,650
The tiger jumped towards me and knocked me down.

479
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,310
I heard someone shouting my name.

480
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,780
Kondiao.

481
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,180
Kondiao.

482
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,030
There was blood everywhere.

483
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,170
But it was not my blood.

484
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,970
I was scared.

485
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,330
But I wish you a good dream.

486
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:42,470

487
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:47,390
do you like Mr. Kondiao?

Yes.

489
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,210
I really like Mr. Kondiao.

490
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,280
Well...

491
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:57,930
I'll invite Mr. Kondiao to accompany you. Okay?

492
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,980
Help! Kondiao. Kondiao.

493

Don't, Mr. Yi.

496
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,400
Lele is in a bad mood today.

497
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,680
That's just because it wants to go out for a walk.

498
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,900
I dreamed of a tiger. The tiger jumped towards me and knocked me down.

Kondiao just lost his mom not long ago. I think his memories about his mom are about to disappear.

502
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,060
I'll take full responsibility.

00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,520
That's enough.

511
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,310
I'm not sure what my dad knows

512
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:11,730
or what he wants from the Chen family.

513
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,840
Even if they get married,

514
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,090
nothing can guarantee that we can get more money from the Chen family.

515
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:18,730
We must.

516
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,880
If anything happens to Kondiao this time,

517
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,840
I'll really kick you out of this family.

518
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,130
You gave up my mom. I think I can put up with that.

519
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,230
Or should I really give him up?

520
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,230
You have regained your memories, right?

521
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:32,230
