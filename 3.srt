00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,910
Are we close?

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,150
You don't even remember me?

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,350
I can't think of anything.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,390
Don't kid me.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,190
This is Kon Diao, your fiancé.

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,390
Why don't you remember him?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,230
I really feel sorry for Hia, Nong.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,750
He doesn't even remember me.

12
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,190
I'm not sure if he'll remember me someday.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,990
Aon, Kon Diao is missing!

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,950
He's booked a flight to Switzerland.

15
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,950

What were you doing?

34
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,810
Kissing you, obviously.

35
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,250
Why did you kiss me?

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,160
I don't know. I just wanted to.

37
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,329
Nothing more.

38
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,010
You were cute,

39
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,350
so I wanted to kiss you.

40
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,250
We usually kiss, don't we?

41
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,690
We're fiancés.

42

No, we don't.

43
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,690
We've kissed, haven't we?

44
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,050
I don't think we've never kissed, though.

45
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,250
You should've asked me nicely.

46
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,770
Do I have to?

47
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,530
You do.

48
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:03,970
Then... may I?

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,450
No, you may not.

50
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,490
I want a kiss!

51
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,329
I want a kiss. A kiss! Kiss me.

52
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,810
Hia...

53
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,610
No whining, please.

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,090
If you won't let me kiss you,

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,090
you have to kiss away my pain.

56
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,810
I was hurt because of you.

57
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,370
Fine.

58
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,730
May your pain go away!

59

Get well soon, Hia.

60
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,090
We're here.

61
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,010
Nong!

62
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,210
This is Nong, my dog.

63
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,490
You gave her to me.

64
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,890
Do you remember that?

65
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,210
You two were madly in love with each other.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,690
You were best friends.

67
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,210
You shared your bed and food.

68
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,010
You spent every night together.

69
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,690
I don't think that's right.

70
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,690
Nong, why are you facing that way?

71
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,010
Are you mad at Hia?

72
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,730
There, there.

73
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,490
It's okay.

74
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,330
He doesn't remember you

75
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,250
because he has lost his memory.

76
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,930
Hia, she's still mad.

77
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,530
Can you make up with her?

78
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,290
With her? I don't know how to do that.

79
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,090
Just give her a kiss,
and she'll stop being mad.

80
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,060
Babe, I think you've gone too far.

81
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,150
Fine!

82
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,040
Here.

83
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,300
Hia!

84
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,450
Let's go, Nong.

85
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,530
Are you still mad at me?

86
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,810
I told you to kiss Nong,

87
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,610
not me.

88
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,330
Oh, yeah? I didn't know.

89
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,010
I thought you meant Nong Diao.

90
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,850
Are you going back to your condo right away?

91
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,930
What condo?

92
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,050
Usually, when you dropped me off,

93
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,330
you'd stay here for just a moment
and return to your condo.

94
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,210
I won't leave you. I'll stay here.

95
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,090
- Usually...
- Well, this is not usual.

96
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,850
Who will look after me if I return to my condo?

97
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,530
But we broke up, Hia.

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,970
Besides,
you haven't stayed here in a long time.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,650
I can't recall.

100
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,850
We talked about this the other day.

101
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,370
You said you would break up with me
after being discharged from the hospital, Hia.

102
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,330
It's because I was confused.

103
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,570
But you promised me.

104
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,400
Where's your evidence?

105
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,250
Do you have any documents?

106
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,650
When did I promise you that we would break up?

107
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,450
Before you lost your memory.

108
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,900
You told me you wanted to break up,

109
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,340
and you would marry someone else.

110
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,980
Do you think you can fool me, Nong Diao?

111
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,130
Who?

112
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,170
Why would I know how many mistresses you had?

113
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,610
Just find one of them,
and then we'll talk about this.

114
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,010
You cheated on me.

115
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,170
You want me to go and search
for your mistresses?

116
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,810
You're such an irresponsible person.

117
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,300
You remember it, but I don't.

118
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,370
Go find them, since you can recall.

119
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,610
If you can't recall, just believe me.

120
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,540
He suddenly started smart-mouthing.

121
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,420
Should I give him one more kiss on the lips?

122
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,580
If you don't have proof,
I won't accept that

123
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,770
we made an agreement.

124
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,780
I don't remember anything.

125
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
What about you? You're caught in 4K.

126
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,820
- Why are you making excuses?
- What do you mean?

127
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,100
Your engagement ring.

128
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,620
Though I've lost my memory,

129
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,450
I'll never forget Chen's ancestral diamond ring

130
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,260
on your left ring finger.

131
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,190
It hurts. Let go of me!

132
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,380
You wouldn't wear it if we'd already broken up.

133
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,100
You told me it was just a small diamond,

134
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,940
- and you could just buy a new one.
- Liar!

135
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,260
I would never say that.

136
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,340
This diamond ring was...

137
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,700
given to the Chen family's ancestor
by the Qing Dynasty emperors.

138
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,380
It's an heirloom that's been passed down
for hundreds of years.

139
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,860
It has a story behind it.

140
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,419
I'm not that kind to give it away to my ex!

141
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,980
Fine! Take it back then.

142
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,880
Try taking it off.

143
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,140
I'll beat you to death.

144
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,220
If you beat me,

145
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,860
- I'll also beat you.
- Kon Diao!

146
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,260
You must understand that

147
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,740
if you beat someone,
they may beat you back.

148
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,140
You're not the greatest person in the world!

149
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,700
I tried to hold it back many times,

150
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,340
but you were just a stubborn person!

151
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,260
You were always upset.

152
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,220
- You're a bad guy.
- Tacha Wongteerawit!

153
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,700
Now you remember me,
Mr. Phayak Chatdecha Chen?

154
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,220
Alright! Come on!

155
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,620
Anything more? Say it!

156
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,820
Ouch!

157
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,180
- Ouch!
- Hia!

158
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,940
Are you okay?

159
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,980
Are you hurt?

160
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,900
You teased me.

161
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,660
You're not worried about me anymore?

162
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,140
I am.

163
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,180
Don't be so stubborn, Hia.

164
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,420
Okay.

165
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,260
I won't be stubborn.

166
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,740
I'll do anything you want.

167
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,860
But may I please stay with you?

168
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,220
Fine.

169
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,340
- But you have to promise me...
- No!

170
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,150
No more promises.

171
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,500
I don't want to have another argument with you.

172
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,900
I'm tired.

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,060
You're too stubborn.

174
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,300
I'm not stubborn.

175
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,460
You're the one who's stubborn.

176
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,660
I'm tired.

177
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,980
My arm hurts.

178
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,820
May I please recharge?

179
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,780
Recharge...?

180
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,060
- May I have a kiss?
- Hia...

181
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,740
Please.

182
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,580
Please have some mercy on this sick guy.

183
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,500
This is your bedroom.

184
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,740
You can sleep here.

185
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,340
I'll sleep in the small bedroom.

186
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,300
- Share the bed with me.
- No.

187
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,500
Why not?

188
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,150
What's the problem?

189
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,980
- Well... we broke up.
- Don't use that as an excuse.

190
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,220
Don't be selfish, Hia.

191
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,940
- Hia...
- I told you to share the bed with me,

192
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,700
and you should.

193
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,530
Hia, let me go!

194
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,770
I need someone to take care of me.

195
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,220
Hia, but...

196
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,470
No buts.

197
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,030
We've done this before, right?

198
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,750
No.

199
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,670
Hia...

200
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,510
I just realized.

201
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,190
When you lie, you'll shake

202
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,750
and avoid eye contact with me.

203
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,310
You're wrong. That's nonsense.

204
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,550
You like it too, don't you?

205
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,030
What do you mean by "it"?

206
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:17,910
"It" means... "this."

207
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,990
Ouch! Ouch!

208
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,790
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,590
Kon Diao, calm down.

210
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,550
Take it easy, Kon Diao.

211
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,710
Get yourself together, Tacha.

212
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,150
May I please come in?

213
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,550
Nong, are you hungry?
Why are you barking?

214
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,790
You must be hungry.

215
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,550
Let's go eat.

216
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,550
That bulging-eyed dog...

217
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,030
Do you want some more?

218
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,070
I'll give you some more.

219
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,550
You're eating happily
after ruining our moment, huh?

220
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,110
I could just eat you up.

221
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,190
You're too cute. Why are you so cute?

222
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,430
I want to squeeze you.

223
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,150
Let me give you a squeeze.

224
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,270
Nong, you're safe now.

225
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,830
I'm here for you.

226
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,710
Mr. Phayak is now recuperating at his home.

227
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,430
As for the accident, it's still not over.

228
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,990
The car is still in police custody.

229
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,750
Right. My special team has already issued
a statement regarding Mr. Yi's accident

230
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,790
and distributed it to various media outlets.

231
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,590
Great.

232
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,550
Please ensure that any media does not mislead
or tarnish the Chen family's business image.

233
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,710
We, my special team and I,
will ensure that they...

234
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,670
zip it.

235
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,270
Thank you for assisting us
during this difficult time, Secretary Kim,

236
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,550
despite the fact that
you just gave birth to your child.

237
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,150
I'm willing to do everything,

238
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,310
literally everything,
for Mr. Yi and the Chen family.

239
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,270
Please excuse me.
I'm going to breastfeed my baby.

240
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:37,670
I have a family now.

241
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,830
Please excuse me.

242
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,070
Increase our security posture at all times

243
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,030
until Mr. Phayak issues an updated order.

244
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,470
- Yes.
- Yes.

245
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,950
I'm hungry. What's the food?

246
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,990
I ordered a pork blood soup
from your favorite restaurant.

247
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,430
You should eat up.

248
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,350
Konn Diao, where are you going?

249
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,110
Come and eat with me.

250
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,710
I ordered only one serving.

251
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,310
Order more of it, then.

252
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,670
I'd rather not.

253
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,390
I'm not a fan of offal.

254
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,270
If you don't eat it, neither will I.

255
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,750
You can't do that.
You must eat and take your medicine.

256
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,630
You haven't eaten anything today.

257
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,350
Ouch!

258
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,150
Ouch!

259
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,310
Ouch! My arm hurts!

260
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,870
Ouch!

261
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,590
Where does it hurt?

262
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,310
I think it's been swollen
since I fell off the bed.

263
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:31,230
Whoa! It's really swollen.

264
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,230
Should you go back to the hospital?

265
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,350
I'll take you there.

266
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,950
I'll feel better
when I take the medications.

267
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,030
Can you please feed me?

268
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,670
Why are you begging like a child?

269
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,230
Am I cute?

270
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,710
You should hurry back to the hospital.

271
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,270
I think you need to
get your brain checked again.

272
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,950
Are you saying that
you like the other version of me better?

273
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,390
I don't like any version of you.

274
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,110
Okay.

275
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,550
I want you to go back to your old self quickly.

276
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,910
So, I'll feed you.

277
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,630
However, you have to finish your food,

278
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,950
take your medicine, and rest.

279
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,590
Stop doing something crazy!

280
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,550
Okay!

281
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,430
As long as you don't leave me,
I'll do anything you tell me to.

282
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,670
Then, sit on the floor.

283
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:39,070
Just kidding. You can sit on the chair.

284
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,910
You'll get tired.

285
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,110
I'm going to feed you now.

286
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,430
You like pork blood curd, right?

287
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,190
Ah!

288
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,030
You really like it, don't you?

289
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,750
I want some liver pieces.

290
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,430
Do you like dog meat?

291
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,430
Nong would be okay.

292
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,710
I won't let you!

293
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,870
Give me a piece of liver.

294
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,350
You can't live alone anymore, can you?

295
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,430
This is just the first day.

296
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,830
I'll teach you a lesson.

297
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,590
You're worn out now, huh?

298
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,830
Have a good night, Hia.

299
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,940
Thank you.

300
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,910
Mr. Phayak is at his home now.

301
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,230
There's one thing
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

302
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,190
One or two more would be great,
don't you think?

303
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,870
It's nothing much.

304
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,910
It's just that...
Mr. Phayak's lost his memory.

305
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,350
Nong, keep it down!

306
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,390
Noisy!

307
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,070
Jeez!

308
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,350
Wait. Wait.

309
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,910
Mr. Aon, how did you get in here?

310
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,830
What are you doing here?

311
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,510
Hello, Mr. Tacha.

312
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,350
I couldn't reach Mr. Phayak.

313
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:48,430
May I know how he's doing?

314
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,550
He's asleep. He hasn't woken up yet.

315
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:54,950
Where are you going?

316
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,830
Mr. Makorn would like to speak with him
at the mansion in two hours.

317
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,230
I see...

318
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,430
I'll wake him up for you.

319
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,830
Please take a seat and wait here.

320
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,070
Okay, there's still time.

321
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,110
- 2 hours.
- Yes.

322
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,390
2 hours?

323
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,270
Okay.

324
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,550
Let's go, Nong. Let's wake Hia up.

325
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,750
What should we do, Nong?

326
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,550
He seems to be sleeping soundly.

327
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,850
I don't want to bother him.

328
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,790
Wait. Wait.

329
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,190
Wait. Wait.

330
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,910
That bulging-eyed dog!

331
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,710
Be careful,
or I'll turn you into meatballs.

332
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,590
Hia...

333
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,270
Even if you've lost your memory,
you still want to eat Nong?

334
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,710
What I've been thinking is coming true?

335
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,910
No.

336
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,950
I...

337
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,910
Why would you scare her like that?

338
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,190
Even if you lost your memory...

339
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,230
Or...

340
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,430
Do you really like dog meat?

341
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,070
Mr. Aon, your secretary, is here
to take you to the mansion to see Makorn.

342
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,990
That bulging-eyed dog, you almost ended me.

343
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,110
I must be more careful.

344
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,310
Diao!

345
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,390
Can you help me get dressed?

346
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,750
It's hard to do it with one hand.

347
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,900
I can help you, sir.

348
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,830
You don't have to.

349
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,350
Let Kon Diao do it.

350
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,830
Hia!

351
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,390
Hia!!

352
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Thank you.

353
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,800
You've been engaged for 3 years now.

354
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,470
Why are you still shy, Kon Diao?

355
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,630
He's the same person.

356
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,030
Why would your heart tremble?

357
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,350
Don't forget what your intention is.

358
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,630
Don't forget what you intend to do.

359
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,710
I completed all of the company work

360
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,950
as you asked, sir.

361
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,710
As for the news of your accident,

362
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,110
everything is under our control.

363
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,310
Don't let anyone know about my symptoms.

364
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,530
Also, check to see

365
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,310
if anyone is acting suspiciously.

366
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,240
Yes, sir.

367
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,070
Where's the car?

368
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,510
At the factory, sir.

369
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:36,350
We just got it back from the police last night.

370
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,790
Send the best possible mechanic team
to figure out the cause.

371
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:42,750
I've already sent one, sir.

372
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,070
I think we'll find out soon.

373
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,070
Why does Dad want to see me?

374
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,110
Did he tell you?

375
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,990
No, sir.

376
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,110
I asked, but...

377
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,150
he said it was a family matter.

378
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,270
A family matter?

379
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,150
How's Kon Diao?

380
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,890
It's me, your son, who got into an accident.

381
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,270
It's not Kon Diao.

382
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,070
You seem fine.

383
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,190
Do you want me to call Kon Diao here, then?

384
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,710
I want to talk to you.

385
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,350
I know what happened.

386
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,670
I don't think you know everything.

387
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,910
Right. Not everything.

388
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,830
I just want to know why.

389
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,310
What did you do to make Diao frustrated?

390
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,070
I don't know. I lost my memory.

391
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,290
Don't ever lie to me.

392
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,390
I'm not lying.

393
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,390
I really have amnesia.

394
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,590
You were there

395
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,150
when the doctor told me I'd lost my memory.

396
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,550
I've been raising you since you were a baby.

397
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,590
I can see through you.

398
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,670
You can't trick me.

399
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,550
You don't have to believe that I have amnesia,

400
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,750
but please believe in my strategies.

401
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,790
I will make use of my amnesia

402
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,230
to uncover the truth.

403
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,270
So you have no idea

404
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:36,390
what you did to upset him so badly

405
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,590
that he would leave you?

406
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,830
- He didn't leave me.
- He almost did.

407
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,070
You're an idiot.

408
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,470
You didn't take good care of him.

409
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,030
You were obsessed with your work.

410
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,310
Who would have that much patience?

411
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,790
Are you talking about me or you, Dad?

412
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,990
I've made mistakes.

413
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,630
That's why I'm educating you now.

414
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,950
You don't have to look up to me
as a role model for stuff like this.

415
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,030
The river has no return.

416
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,830
I can't go back in time and undo what happened.

417
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,350
However, you have a chance to start over.

418
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,870
Make up with him.

419
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,150
Between me and Kon Diao,

420
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,590
- you prefer...
- Kon Diao.

421
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,310
I'm your son.

422
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,550
- I am your son.
- Kon Diao.

423
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,710
Fine.

424
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,510
Appreciate that.

425
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,630
How's it going? Spill the tea.

426
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,070
I'm not very sure now, Kuea.

427
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,790
- Is it because you're worried about Hia Yi?
- Mm...

428
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,550
Hia has become a different person
since having amnesia.

429
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,590
How?

430
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:20,030
He's now...

431
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,180
Now what?

432
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,390
He's now so sweet!

433
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,750
- What? Hia Yi?
- Yeah.

434
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,590
It's unbelievable, right?

435
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,950
He's turned into a needy person.

436
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,990
He's even warmer than a microwave.

437
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,030
Wait. I think it's safe to say
he's as warm as a BBQ grill.

438
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,710
Wow!

439
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,030
When I'm near him, my heart melts.

440
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,230
Whoa!

441
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,230
You have now become a pork belly!

442
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,510
He's too sweet to handle, Kuea.

443
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,830
Yeah, you're right.

444
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,030
Let's eat.

445
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,350
Come on. Let's eat.

446
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,790
You're so good at ruining my moment.

447
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,350
Get up. Let's eat.

448
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,390
Why are you so hungry?

449
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,950
Talking to you made me hungry.

450
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,550
But there's one thing that confuses me.

451
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:29,030
- What is it?
- Well, Hia...

452
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,750
I think he hates Nong's guts.

453
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,230
Even if he has amnesia, he still hates her.

454
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,020
You know what I'm thinking?

455
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,140
It made me think that
if the old him didn't want to marry me

456
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,780
and his memory returned,

457
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:46,020
he'd be the same as before.

458
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,620
I do want him to recover,

459
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,980
but that might also mean that
I have to leave him.

460
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,140
Try thinking about it the other way around.

461
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:02,700
The fact that he is as warm
as a BBQ grill right now

462
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,470
might be due to his deep love for you.

463
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,590
Don't cross the bridge until you come to it.

464
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,150
Now, I think you should put
your own needs first.

465
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,910
You should talk things out with Hia as well.

466
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,910
About moving to Switzerland,

467
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,390
if you still want to go there,
I think you should go.

468
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,750
Meanwhile, take advantage of this time
to reconsider your feelings.

469
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,390
Will I be able to do that?

470
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,590
Of course.

471
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:41,230
Whatever you decide,
I'll always be here for you.

472
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,150
I love you, Kuea.

473
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,310
I love you too.

474
00:42:58,350 --> 00:42:59,150
Hia Yi!

475
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,470
Hia...

476
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,030
How did you get here?

477
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,630
Aon took me here.

478
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,150
The door's not locked.

479
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,560
Who the hell are you?

480
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,670
Who's this, Kon Diao?

481
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,150
It's Kuea, Hia.

482
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,030
I'm Kuea Keerati Wang,

483
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,870
the life partner of Lian Kilen Wang,

484
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,270
your best friend.

485
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:27,830
He also owns this house.

486
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,150
I see. You're his husband.

487
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:33,790
How dare you pinch Kon Diao's cheeks?

488
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:36,070
Why can't I?

489
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,830
We've been like this for a long time.

490
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,910
Kon Diao, are you cheating on me?

491
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,310
I'm not, Hia.

492
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,790
We're just friends.

493
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:48,990
Well...

494
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,390
We really do love each other so much.

495
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,470
Like, very much.

496
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,710
I've not just pinched his cheeks.

497
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,310
I've also kissed him on the cheek.

498
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,870
- Have you?
- That's enough, Kuea.

499
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,150
I've done things you've never done.

500
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,190
What have you done with Diao?

501
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,590
- What?
- Taking a roller-coaster ride, maybe?

502
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,040
Jeez! Stop it. That's enough.

503
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,830
You and Hia Lian also do stuff like this,
don't you?

504
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,110
Stuff like this?

505
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,430
I love you, Yi.

506
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,630
I love you too, Lian.

507
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,790
- You're the cutest.
- You're so cute.

508
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,030
We've never done that!

509
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,550
We're just friends, though.

510
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,590
He's not cheating on you.

511
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,110
- He's not like you, Hia Yi.
- What the hell are you talking about, kiddo?

512
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:51,990
Before the accident occurred

513
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,710
and before we broke up,

514
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,510
- you really did cheat on me.
- That's not true.

515
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:57,630
- I've never cheated on you.
- You have.

516
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,790
You just lost your memory.

517
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:00,750
That's impossible.

518
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,270
I would never do that.

519
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,430
You're so convinced, huh?

520
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,630
But someone who doesn't know how to lie
told me about this.

521
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,070
He would never lie to me.

522
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,710
Who? When?

523
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:16,710
Say it!

524
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,910
- Hi, Tacha.
- How can you do that to me?

525
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,450
Ing-ing Chatchada.

526
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,630
She's a celebrity
who bought a car from your showroom.

527
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,270
The other one is Aun-aun, a flight attendant.

528
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,390
Hey, Kon Diao.

529
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,030
You might think I know nothing.

530
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,950
In fact, it's the opposite.

531
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:48,070
You know everything? How?

532
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,840
You probably don't know what you've done,

533
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:52,750
but I do remember everything.

534
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:55,390
Here.

535
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:02,870
Isn't that the Princess Gang?

536
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,510
What is the Princess Gang?

537
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,510
There. She's Ing-ing Chatchada.

538
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:09,790
You said she was your distant relative.

539
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,310
Right. It's her.

540
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,190
Should we say hi to her?

541
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,070
I don't think we should.
We haven't spoken since we were kids.

542
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,590
Wait. Hia Yi's here.

543
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,270
Ladies,
can you give me some time to talk to Hia?

544
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,790
Then, we'll go to the toilet.

545
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,070
Hia! That's too much!

546
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,870
You think he's cheating on Kon Diao?

547
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:02,230
Of course.

548
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,790
I don't think he is. Believe me.

549
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:04,830
Stop it.

550
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,670
- But...
- This is none of your business.

551
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,830
Don't take sides.

552
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:09,190
We'll handle this.

553
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:12,350
If we're here,
how will we know what they're talking about?

554
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,510
The Buddha taught us

555
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,230
not to believe everything right away.

556
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,390
You should first employ your mindfulness,

557
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:22,030
intelligence,

558
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,350
and dedicated thought and consideration.

559
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:28,270
Fine.

560
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,630
If this was his first time,
I wouldn't believe it.

561
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,430
But something similar happened before.

562
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,230
You sent me the photos, Sil.

563
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,110
Nuea,
can you buy me a bottle of water?

564
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,550
Nuea, I have to go now.

565
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:47,190
That's Yi, Kon Diao's fiancé.

566
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,150
That woman...

567
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:54,110
No, no, Sil. Don't think this way.

568
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,310
It can't be what I'm thinking.

569
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:58,830
No, Sil!

570
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,310
Kon Diao is Kuea's friend.

571
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,150
Kuea's my friend.

572
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:04,670
It can't be.

573
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,030
No, Sil!

574
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,990
I have to help my friend.

575
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:19,110
Sil, you can't take photos of them.

576
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,430
You don't have their permission. It's a sin.

577
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:22,890
It's a sin.

578
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,750
It's not, Sil.

579
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:25,610
It is.

580
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:27,350
It's a sin.

581
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,850
It's not a sin.

582
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,590
It's not a sin, Sil. It's not.

583
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,420
- Sil!
- Huh?

584
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,400
Nuea.

585
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,910
What happened?
Why did you hang up so quickly?

586
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,540
What are you looking at?

587
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,310
No. Nothing.

588
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:49,550
Nuea, let's say...

589
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,390
you saw your friend's
friend's boyfriend with...

590
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,470
another woman
who's not your friend's friend.

591
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:06,830
Would you tell your friend
to tell your friend's friend?

592
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:13,230
If you're not close to them,
I don't think you should.

593
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,590
They might get into problems

594
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,990
if you misunderstand.

595
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:18,590
I'm close to them.

596
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,110
It's up to you, then.

597
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,390
If telling them helps you feel better

598
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,670
and is useful to them,

599
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:26,830
do so.

600
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:34,870
"I undertake the precept
to refrain from sexual misconduct."

601
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,070
You've got it all wrong.

602
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:45,910
Why didn't you just ask me?

603
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:47,750
Would you answer me if I asked?

604
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:51,350
One hundred percent of cheaters are liars.

605
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,590
So, I asked someone
who would never lie to me.

606
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,110
It's Hia Lian.

607
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:01,070
He also clarified that

608
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:04,230
you're really close to Ing-ing Chatchada

609
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,430
and the flight attendant, Aun-aun.

610
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,510
Lian!

611
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:24,510
You're all here.

612
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,770
Please do me a favor.

613
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,250
Tell Kuea about it.

614
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,650
I know he cares about Kon Diao,

615
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,600
but if it's between Kon Diao and I,
leave it to me.

616
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,740
- You're taking advantage of Kon Diao.
- I know.

617
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:01,720
- But I...
- Tell him the truth.

618
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,560
You don't like it
when Kon Diao hears your story from others.

619
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:04,670
I believe it goes the same way.

620
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:05,480
Lian!

621
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,300
I understand why you don't want to be with me.

622
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:10,300
But that doesn't mean I'll feel nothing

623
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,320
when I see you're gone.

624
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:12,610
I dreamed of a tiger,

625
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,100
it terrified me every time.

626
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,410
Will I still see you around when I wake up?
