16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,750
Let me check your lungs.

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,430
Excuse me.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,030
Take a deep breath.

19
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,620
Let me see your eyes as well.

20
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,710
Look straight, please.

21
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,310
According to your vital signs,

22
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,190
your physical condition is normal.

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,670
You only sprained your arm.

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,190
According to the x-ray results,
there are no fractures.

25
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,470
I'll keep your arm bandaged

26
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,070
to minimize your movement.

27
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,789
I'm Phayak, The Indestructible.

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,110
Try not to move your arm.

29
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,789
You must be under
the supervision of your relatives.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,270
You'll feel better in 2-3 weeks.

31
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,470
Avoid lifting heavy objects

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,510
or crushing your arm.

33
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,990
Can you tell me your name again, please?

34
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,910
My name?

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,590
I'm Phayak Chatdecha Chen.

36
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,910
Chatdecha is my middle name after my mom's.

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,470
Her name is Chatchai.

38
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,060
My surname, Chen,
is derived from my father's ancestor.

39
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,470
He's the one pouting over there.

40
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,270
What about the person next to your father?
Do you recall him?

41
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,030
He told me his name was Kon Diao, Tacha.

42
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,670
I don't think that's his name.

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,790
Tacha, whom I know, is just seven years old.

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,790
How old are you?

45
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,630
What about you?

46
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,700
Yi!

47
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,030
I'm sorry for that, doctor.

48
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,590
You're already 32 years old.

49
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,710
This is Kon Diao, your fiancé.
Why don't you remember him?

50
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,430
What fiancé? Don't joke with me.

51
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:01,710
Do you remember what you were doing
or where you were going

52
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,950
before the accident?

53
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,790
What is your most recent memory?

54
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,070
I can't recall.

55
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,750
I remember my dad.

56
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,829
I remember my mom.

57
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,750
But I don't remember what happened.

58
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,430
According to the diagnosis findings,
your physical condition is normal.

59
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,270
Because you passed out
and woke up with no memory of the incident,

60
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,110
as well as recalling this person
as a 7-year-old child,

61
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,310
I'd like to refer your case to neurosurgeons

62
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,390
and emergency diagnostic radiologists.

63
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,030
I'd also like to draw your blood
to further investigate the cause.

64
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,750
Okay.

65
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,630
Hia.

66
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,630
Have some water.

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,590
I've had enough.

68
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,270
Drinking a lot of water makes me want to pee.

69
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,390
Then, tell me if you want anything.

70
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,830
I want to sleep.

71
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,110
I'm sleepy.

72
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,150
Okay.

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,030
You don't have to watch over me.

74
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,310
I won't leave you.

75
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,950
My father's guards are everywhere.

76
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,390
In case you have something to do.

77
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,030
It's fine.

78
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,550
I can stay here.

79
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,710
What do I usually call you?

80
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,190
Honey,

81
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,390
darling,

82
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,870
my love, or Nong?

83
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,390
It's Nong.

84
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,230
You usually call me Nong Diao.

85
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,950
You call yourself Hia.

86
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,790
Really?

87
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,030
Are we actually engaged
or am I being tricked by my dad?

88
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,550
We're actually engaged.

89
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,320
How is that possible?

90
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,909
We're both male.

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,270
The same-sex marriage law
has now been approved, Hia.

92
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,430
It's 2026.

93
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,270
Same-sex couples can now lawfully marry.

94
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,990
Do we love each other?

95
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,430
I mean, when did we get engaged?

96
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,909
We've been engaged for about 3 years.

97
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,710
3 years? Why didn't we get married?

98
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,990
It's because... Actually, we were breaking up.

99
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,070
Even if we've been engaged for 3 years?

100
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,150
Why is that?

101
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,350
You cheated on me.

102
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,390
That's not true.

103
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,230
It's impossible.

104
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,950
Despite my memory loss,

105
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,230
I will never forget what Dad taught me.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,310
He told me to love Kon Diao.

107
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,230
I mean, he told me to be loyal and faithful.

108
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,310
I would never forget that.

109
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,950
You didn't forget.

110
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,750
You were stubborn.

111
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,710
- You wouldn't follow your dad's advice.
- I was stubborn?

112
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,990
- Yes, you were.
- That's not true.

113
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,150
I don't recall any of those.

114
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,030
Yes, you don't.

115
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,590
That's why you have to believe me.

116
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,790
You ended our relationship and cheated on me.

117
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,670
I was going to move to Europe for a while.

118
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,830
Why are you still here?

119
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,750
Did I let you down?

120
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,710
Are you mad at me?

121
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,030
You probably are,

122
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,830
because I don't remember anything.

123
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,910
If I have ever failed you,

124
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,150
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,670
It's fine if you hate me.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,350
I really don't understand why I did that.

127
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,470
And the fact that I mistook you
for a seven-year-old boy...

128
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,390
I must have lost my mind.

129
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,190
I'm no longer 7 years old.

130
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,390
I'm 25 now.

131
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,270
You're still the same.

132
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,110
Did you say you wanted to sleep?

133
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,789
I'll let you sleep.

134
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,669
I'll find something to eat.

135
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,550
Kon Diao.

136
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,950
How's Yi doing?

137
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,830
He's better now.

138
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,950
But...

139
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,070
he lost his memory.

140
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,270
Really? How?

141
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,790
You should see it for yourself.

142
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,870
I don't know how to explain it.

143
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,190
You can see him first.

144
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,350
I'll have a talk with Kon Diao for a second.

145
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,710
Are you okay?

146
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,110
Let's talk over there.

147
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,630
Is he really that bad?

148
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,150
Why is it so terrifying?

149
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,190
You should've seen his eyes
when he looked at me.

150
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,230
He was blanking.

151
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,990
He looked at me
as if I were someone he didn't know.

152
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,990
Don't overthink it.

153
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,590
He'll be fine.

154
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,670
What if he won't?

155
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,110
What if he forgets me forever?

156
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,710
Don't cross the bridge until you come to it.

157
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,310
You have to stay strong.

158
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,710
There's one thing that I find strange.

159
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,870
If I tell you this, can you not tell anyone?

160
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,390
Sure.

161
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,150
You can tell me everything.

162
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,790
Don't tell Hia Lian either.

163
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,390
Mm.

164
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,350
Hia Yi said that Kon Diao Tacha,
whom he is acquainted with,

165
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,390
- is a 7-year-old boy.
- What?

166
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,270
7 years old?

167
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,150
I don't know how he met me when I was seven.

168
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,910
I don't recall ever seeing him before.

169
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,630
It's true that my family is indebted to Makorn,

170
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,070
but the first time I saw him
after returning from the UK

171
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,990
was when I was eighteen.

172
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,590
You two may have met when you were younger,
and he recalls you.

173
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,870
He's 7 years older than us.

174
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,750
It's not strange.

175
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,390
Why would you want me to keep it a secret?

176
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,230
Why don't you just ask Hia Yi or your family?

177
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,030
I don't know. I think it's strange.

178
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,430
It's as if I've never heard of it before.

179
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,710
Perhaps this will explain a lot about
my relationship with him.

180
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,950
It might be the reason we have to marry.

181
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,870
It might be nothing.

182
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,290
Nurse answering.

183
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,350
Yes, I'll get to it.

184
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,990
Zen, get the medication for room 10.

185
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,910
Back off.

186
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,000
Let go of me! Let me go!

187
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,350
- Yi!
- Let me go!

188
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,850
Take it easy, Yi.

189
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,500
- Let go of me!
- Yi.

190
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,460
- Yi!
- Let go of me! Let me go!

191
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,890
Let go of me!

192
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,520
- Stay still.
- Let go of me!

193
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,560
Let me go!

194
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,340
Thank you.

195
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,260
Hia,

196
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,220
I'm sorry.

197
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,820
It's my fault that...

198
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,020
you've been in this situation.

199
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,220
Lele! Where are you, Lele?

200
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,680
Lele!

201
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,440
Kon Diao! Kon Diao!

202
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,140
Kon Diao! Uncle!

203
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,320
Uncle!

204
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:06,560
Can someone help us?

205
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,680
Help! Lele has escaped!

206
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,320
Can somebody help us? Now!

207
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,880
Hey! Help us!

208
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,800
I, Phayak Chatdecha Chen,

209
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,640
the owner of Chen Circuit,

210
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,120
will marry Mr. Tacha Wongteerawit shortly.

211
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,520
Aon, Kon Diao is missing!

212
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,240
Kuea Keerati Wang, where did you hide him?
Where's your secret house, Kuea?

213
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,120
I found him, sir.

214
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,440
He's booked a flight to Switzerland.

215
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:43,960
The flight leaves at 10.30 P.M.

216
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,840
Kon Diao.

217
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,200
Let me go.

218
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,480
Let me go. Let me go.

219
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,360
I told you to let me go.

220
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,600
If you two don't let me go

221
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,200
and I escape,

222
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,200
I'll absolutely end you.

223
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,520
Let me go, now!

224
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,440
Are you okay, Mr. Phayak?

225
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,960
Where's my phone? I need it.

226
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,080
Your phone is with Aon, your secretary.

227
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
I know who he is.

228
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,200
Go get him.

229
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,360
Now!

230
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,040
Yes, sir?

231
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,800
Where's Kon Diao?

232
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,080
How far has he gotten?

233
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,400
Mr. Tacha just left at 10 P.M.

234
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,400
He said he'd stay with Nong at home.

235
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,640
He'll come here again in the morning.

236
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,560
Didn't he go to Switzerland?

237
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,000
Mr. Tacha didn't go anywhere, sir.

238
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,440
He's been here, taking care of you,
since the beginning.

239
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,800
He just left a few hours ago.

240
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,440
You've already met him, sir.

241
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,320
When?

242
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,760
Since the morning.

243
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,920
You woke up and saw Mr. Tacha, sir.

244
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,400
Why can't I recall anything?

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,800
Well...

246
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,960
You lost your memory, sir.

247
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,520
Do you remember what you were doing
or where you were going

248
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,000
before the accident?

249
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,079
- What is your most recent memory?
- I can't recall.

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,880
I remember my dad.

251
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,280
We were breaking up.

252
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,359
- You cheated on me.
- It's impossible.

253
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
I will never forget what Dad taught me.

254
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,319
He told me to love Kon Diao.

255
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,960
Did I really lose my memory?

256
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,760
What happened?

257
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,840
You've...

258
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,560
done so many things.

259
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,360
What have I done?

260
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,160
Try thinking about it.

261
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,520
I'll let you sleep.

262
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,240
I'll find something to eat.

263
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,840
Wait. Don't enter just yet.

264
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,640
How are you doing?

265
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,080
I told you to wait, sir.

266
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,360
You're talking to your friend so politely
after you've lost your memory, huh?

267
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,080
Who are you?

268
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,840
You don't even remember me?

269
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,440
I'm offended.

270
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,280
Are we close?

271
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,200
We're really close.

272
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,600
We have a profound bond, to put it honestly.

273
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,120
Are you telling me that you and I are...

274
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,560
having an affair?

275
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,480
No, that's not true.

276
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,640
Where's Kon Diao?

277
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,240
Do you remember him?

278
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,560
No.

279
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,800
Aside from my dad, he's the only person I know.

280
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,520
He's with Nu Kuea outside.

281
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,640
Nu Kuea?

282
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,520
Who's Nu Kuea?

283
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,630
My love.

284
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,600
- Your love?
- Right.

285
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,480
We've been married for over 3 years.

286
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,360
Nu Kuea is Kon Diao's best friend.

287
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,360
And you're my best friend.

288
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,520
I'm Lian.

289
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,920
I own the Kilen brand of water,
which you drink.

290
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,640
Water?

291
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,000
Kilen?

292
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,760
Lian?

293
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,600
You're starting to remember?

294
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,680
Take it easy, Yi. You'll remember it.

295
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,960
We were breaking up.

296
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,760
- You don't even remember me?
- We've been engaged for about 3 years.

297
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,680
- You cheated on me.
- Why don't you remember your fiancé?

298
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,360
Urgh!

299
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:24,640
- I can't think of anything.
- Calm down, Yi.

300
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,840
Take it easy.

301
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,160
What the f*ck is wrong with me?
I can't think of anything.

302
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,480
Where are you going?

303
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,920
Sit right here.

304
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,620
Lian.

305
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,780
I kicked him.

306
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Though I can't recall it,
I will never forget that.

307
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,840
Mr. Lian might never forget it either, sir.

308
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,320
Great, he deserved it.

309
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,640
What happened after that?

310
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,520
I can't recall anything.

311
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,160
- Yi!
- Hey! It hurts!

312
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,090
Guards!

313
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,480
Back off.

314
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,600
Anyone who blocks me will be fired.

315
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,760
Mr. Makorn has given us the order

316
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
- not to let you go anywhere.
- Forget him.

317
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,680
How could you cage me here?

318
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,800
He's not a cop.

319
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,400
The patient is on a rampage.
Please have a nurse come in.

320
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,320
Hey! Let me go.

321
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,360
Let me go. Urgh.

322
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,460
- Yi.
- Let me go.

323
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,480
- Let go of me.
- Yi, calm down.

324
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,600
- Let me go.
- Stay still.

325
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,000
- Let go of me.
- Yi.

326
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Take it easy, Yi.

327
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
- Let me go.
- Yi.

328
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,040
- Let go of me.
- Yi.

329
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,160
Let me go.

330
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,400
Let me go.

331
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,040
- Stay still.
- Let go of me.

332
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,480
Come inside, Aon, and we'll discuss.

333
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,360
Tell them to wait outside.

334
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,760
Wait outside.

335
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,150
Aon,

336
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,800
my memory has now returned.

337
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,080
I'm still confused about
what happened yesterday.

338
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,320
You must not tell anyone
about my current condition.

339
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,400
Don't tell my dad either.

340
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,800
Don't ever tell Kon Diao.

341
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,760
Yes, sir.

342
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,120
Don't tell the guards.

343
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,320
Replace them with our people tomorrow.

344
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,680
I don't want my dad's people messing around.

345
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,920
Yes, sir.

346
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,440
I have something for you to do.

347
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,080
Lian...

348
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,330
Hello, Mr. Lian. I've arrived at your house.

349
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,450
Please.

350
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,210
What is it?

351
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,930
Yi's gone into a coma.

352
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,670
Yi.

353
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,490
I'll find Nu Kuea.

354
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,500
It's too late.

355
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,530
You have to go to the hospital now, sir.

356
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,970
Let me call Nu Kuea first.

357
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,010
You have to go now.

358
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:43,850
Please.

359
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,610
Yi!

360
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,090
What kind of joke are you making?

361
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,690
Are you so concerned about me
that you came here in your pajamas?

362
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,770
What's your problem?

363
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,370
I want your help.

364
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,050
Before asking for my help,

365
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,210
won't you say sorry to me first?

366
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,370
Sit right here.

367
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,610
Sorry for what?

368
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,210
Did I just get kicked for nothing?

369
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,740
You also tricked me to get here.

370
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,850
You're talking too much.

371
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,650
Yi, look what you've done.

372
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,050
Be careful.

373
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,730
I'll have Kon Diao move in with me and Nu Kuea.

374
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,450
- And because you lost your memory...
- Lian!

375
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,690
Your memory has now returned, hasn't it?

376
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,770
Instead of having Nu Kuea
and Kon Diao with you,

377
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,130
why don't you let Nu Kuea live with me
and Kon Diao?

378
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,090
We'll see if Nu Kuea will stay with you

379
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,850
or Kon Diao.

380
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,010
Well, it depends.

381
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,250
You're not the same person you used to be.

382
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,330
Yi, who you can't recall, is

383
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,450
kind, sweet, polite,

384
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,610
and very friendly.

385
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,690
Me? Friendly?

386
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,650
Look at you now.

387
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,690
How can you be certain
that he's going to be with you?

388
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,850
Fine.

389
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,210
I'm sorry.

390
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,530
Aon!

391
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,450
Is there something wrong?

392
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,250
Fine, I'm sorry.

393
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,890
For what?

394
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:26,850
For kicking you.

395
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,850
I only accept apologies in cryptocurrency.

396
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,090
What?

397
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,130
Do I have to give you my coins?

398
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,410
Your memory returned,

399
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,770
but you lied to me.

400
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,890
- How would you know?
- Why wouldn't I?

401
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,890
Done.

402
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,290
Apology accepted.

403
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,730
What's your problem?

404
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,650
Why did you trick me to get here?

405
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,530
Kon Diao told me that we were breaking up

406
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,970
because I cheated on him.

407
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,250
Why did he say that?

408
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,240
I also want to know.

409
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:18,930
From your love, maybe.

410
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,410
Don't mention my love.

411
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,890
I'll find out soon.

412
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,850
But I'm wondering...

413
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,410
why he lied to me.

414
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,850
Why did he say I cheated on him?

415
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,050
Is there something more to it?

416
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,050
Why did you bring me here?

417
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,930
I have no idea about this at all.

418
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,730
Why don't you talk to Kon Diao?

419
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,050
He wouldn't tell me the truth.

420
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,020
He was leaving me for Switzerland.

421
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,870
Though he seems obedient,
he's actually stubborn.

422
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,930
He would never tell me the truth.

423
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,330
If my memory didn't return,

424
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,650
I would have to let him go.

425
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,130
What are you going to do?

426
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,530
I'll pretend.

427
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,210
I'll pretend I lost my memory.

428
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,690
Now, we'll see what that naughty boy will do.

429
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,540
I know some excellent acting coaches.
Do you want me to contact them for you?

430
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,330
You're the one who has to learn how to pretend.

431
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,610
It's not funny.

432
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,650
You'll also have to pretend.

433
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,730
And you'll do it perfectly.

434
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,570
If you believe it,

435
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,530
Nu Kuea will also believe it.

436
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,890
No, I don't want to lie to my love.

437
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,730
I'm not saying you have to lie.

438
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,730
Just pretend that my memory hasn't returned.

439
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,730
Please.

440
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,410
I have to win Kon Diao over.

441
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,250
There are no winners or losers.

442
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,570
You don't know what he's thinking.

443
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,810
He doesn't know what you're thinking.

444
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,410
If you want to understand each other,

445
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,370
you have to be his doggo.

446
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,170
Look how he treats Nong.

447
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,600
Yeah.

448
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,090
Our lives are always changing.

449
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,050
If you want to start over with him, just do it.

450
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,210
If you want to pretend that
you've lost your memory

451
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,450
and are crazy,

452
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,690
I'll help you.

453
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,610
Thank you for your understanding.

454
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,170
Okay.

455
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,570
If people understand that
my memory hasn't returned,

456
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,730
I might be able to see things more clearly.

457
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,050
It's not only about Kon Diao.

458
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,020
The incident has tarnished
Chen's Dealer's reputation.

459
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,730
I checked all my cars.

460
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,290
Especially since I was driving it by myself,
this shouldn't have happened.

461
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,450
I wouldn't lose control at that speed.

462
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,930
Someone must have messed with my car.

463
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,090
Are you sure?

464
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,090
I can't say I'm sure,

465
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,330
but I believe this accident was
caused by someone.

466
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,050
I have to find out who they are.

467
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,530
Nong...

468
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,610
I really feel sorry for Hia, Nong.

469
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,250
He's not only injured
but also suffers from memory loss.

470
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,490
He doesn't even remember me.

471
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:38,050
I'm not sure if he'll remember me someday.

472
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,530
It might be good for him, though.

473
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:02,770
He won't feel anything

474
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,090
when I'm gone.

475
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,130
I won't have to worry about him.

476
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,490
You too, Nong.

477
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,170
If I'm gone,

478
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,730
you'll have to learn to forget me.

479
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,530
If I couldn't come back to take you with me,

480
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,890
you'd have to learn to be alone.

481
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,450
You are better than me.

482
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,160
Do you know why you ended up like this?

483
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,650
You mean in the hospital?

484
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:53,370
I mean, how do you end up trying to figure out
why he's leaving you?

485
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,810
He's not leaving me.

486
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,970
He just wants space.

487
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,850
Did he say he wanted space?

488
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,100
Why would you rub it in?

489
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,770
Yi,

490
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,890
before you can address an issue,
you must first identify its root cause.

491
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,010
I don't know what he's thinking.

492
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,010
Of course.

493
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,810
If you knew, you wouldn't be like this.

494
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:21,410
Try asking yourself
why you were so cold to him.

495
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,410
Why are you engaged but not married?

496
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,290
Something happened in the past that I...

497
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,290
He almost died because of me.

498
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,690
I also ruined someone's life.

499
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,890
Can I take Lele for a walk?

500
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,850
I don't think you should, Mr. Yi.

501
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,450
Lele's not in a good mood.

502
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,050
That's because he wants to go for a walk.

503
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,490
- I think...
- Don't be scared of my dad.

504
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,490
Don't follow me.

505
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,690
I'll handle him.

506
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,250
Okay.

507
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,610
Lele! Where are you, Lele?

508
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,010
Lele!

509
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:35,370
Come here, Lele!

510
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,760
Lele!

511
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,530
Where are you, Lele?

512
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,429
Lele!

513
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,449
Come here, Lele! Hurry!

514
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,690
Where are you hiding, Lele?

515
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,370
Where are you, Lele?

516
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,570
Come here, Lele!

517
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,090
Come to me.

518
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,270
Lele!

519
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:06,490
Kon Diao!

520
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,450
Kon Diao!

521
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,210
Uncle!

522
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,890
Can someone help us?

523
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,090
Can somebody help us?

524
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,530
Help us!

525
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,130
Lele has escaped! Can somebody help us?

526
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,410
Now! Help!

527
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,010
Hey! Help us!

528
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,930
Help us! Help!

529
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,250
Now!

530
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,530
Come here! Hey!

531
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,380
Kon Diao recently lost his mother.

532
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,850
He has few memories of his mother.

533
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,410
And this happened...

534
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,890
I'll take care of everything.

535
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,570
You can trust me.

536
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,550
Following what happened that day,

537
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,510
Lele was transferred
to a wildlife rescue center.

538
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,830
Although it is legal
for my family to keep Lele,

539
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,550
Dad believed we should no longer do so.

540
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,670
Lele's caretaker turned blind in both eyes.

541
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,870
He went from being a diligent worker
to becoming disabled.

542
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:56,310
His family left him.
Not long after that, he left this world.

543
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,550
And Kon Diao...

544
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,990
He was no different than a doll.

545
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,550
He became a boy with breath but no soul.

546
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,950
I was the reason
he lost most of his childhood memories.

547
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,870
It was completely my fault.

548
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,340
At the time, I never even...

549
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,360
apologized.

550
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,750
That's why I've been
repeating the same nightmare.

551
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,550
It made me scared of approaching him

552
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,010
in case I made another mistake.

553
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,790
The stronger our relationship became,

554
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,750
the more nightmares I had.

555
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,270
Each morning after I wake up,

556
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,750
I feel guilty.

557
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,460
I still don't trust myself

558
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,030
to be the person
who can actually make him happy.

559
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,430
Have you ever told Kon Diao about this?

560
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,050
Not just Kon Diao.

561
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,090
I've never told anyone about this.

562
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,850
This is the first time.

563
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,490
You should tell him directly.

564
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,090
I think he's mature now.

565
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,810
He might understand you.

566
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,090
He might understand,

567
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,610
but will he really forgive me?

568
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,210
He almost died because of me.

569
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:30,810
He lost his memory.

570
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,890
And my dad sent him to study in the UK.

571
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,570
He was practically cut off from his own family.

572
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,250
You told me it was a good thing.

573
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,370
I don't know if it's best for Kon Diao.

574
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,730
Is this why you keep putting off...

575
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:48,970
the wedding?

576
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,530
It's not the only reason.

577
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,450
After Lele's incident,

578
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,650
the Wongteerawit family
won't stop demanding more.

579
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,170
His father is not the major concern.

580
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:03,010
It's Sathaporn, Kon Diao's stepmother.

581
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,650
She acts like a wire-puller,

582
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,010
always manipulating Kon Diao's father
to take advantage of the Chen family.

583
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,570
I think they're holding Kon Diao captive

584
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,570
in order to force my dad to do things for them.

585
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,130
On the day we were engaged,

586
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,570
Dad had the Wongteerawit family
sign an engagement contract

587
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,350
with the condition that if we did not marry,

588
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:31,110
cheated on each other,
or broke up within 5 years,

589
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,650
if the Chen family broke the contract,

590
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,310
we'd have to pay the Wongteerawit
family money for the racing track,

591
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,870
but if the Wongteerawit family was at fault,
the land would belong to the Chen family.

592
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,750
I'm not okay with the conditions.

593
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,870
I'm still trying to figure out
how to cope with it.

594
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,670
Does the Wongteerawit family
own the racing circuit's land?

595
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,550
Just part of it, not all.

596
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,370
They made my dad buy the land.

597
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,970
My dad then bought the land around it

598
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,630
and built the racing track on it.

599
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,530
This is a serious matter.

600
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,050
There's something more serious.

601
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,930
I just realized.

602
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:23,690
The car that was involved
in the accident was Kon Diao's.

603
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,770
This is a gift for my new son.

604
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,010
Does this mean...

605
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,370
Right, someone must have messed with the car.

606
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:41,130
I was not the target.

607
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,540
It was Kon Diao.

608
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,250
Who do you suspect?

609
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,810
Who else is there besides the Wongteerawits?

610
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,250
He never had any disputes with anyone.

611
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,930
I have to be pessimistic.

612
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,850
I will find out the truth.

613
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,490
They tried to wake a sleeping tiger.

614
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,370
Unfortunately, I was the driver.

615
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,570
I was able to control the car, so I survived.

616
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,570
Therefore, Lian,

617
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:09,930
you have to help me.

618
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,250
You must convince everyone
that I still have amnesia.

619
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,210
I will.

620
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:43,770
We'll take care of him after this.

621
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,250
Where's Hia Yi?

622
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,330
He's undergoing an MRI scan, sir.

623
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,850
He'll be back soon.

624
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:09,930
Thank you.

625
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:11,850
Alright.

626
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:24,210
According to your blood vessels
and brain tissue,

627
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,090
no abnormalities were found.

628
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,810
But why can't I recall anything, doctor?

629
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:39,650
Ouch!

630
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,730
My head is in a lot of pain.

631
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,770
Is it?

632
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,530
Your memory loss has nothing to do
with your headache, though.

633
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,690
I didn't get much sleep last night.

634
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,410
Hmm... It's probably caused by stress.

635
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,780
Then, I'll write a report
for the doctor in charge of your case

636
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:02,970
to provide you with painkillers.

637
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,290
Doctor, will my memory return?

638
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,930
Hm...

639
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:13,930
I don't have an answer yet.

640
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,210
I'll write a report
for the doctor in charge of your case

641
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,340
to further examine.

642
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,370
You might be suffering from
acute amnesia of unknown cause.

643
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,410
So... I have acute amnesia, right?

644
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,690
- That's right.
- Okay.

645
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,090
Great.

646
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,490
Kon Diao.

647
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,370
Do you want me to wake Mr. Tacha...

648
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,570
Hia, why did you kiss me?

649
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:07,810
What were you trying to do?

650
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:09,810
Kissing you, obviously.

651
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,280
Kissing me...?

652
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,660
You said you would break up with me
after being discharged from the hospital, Hia.

653
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,580
When did I promise you that we would break up?

654
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:46,410
Where's your evidence?

655
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,300
Do you have any documents?

656
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,700
Hia has become a different person
since having amnesia.

657
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,890
He's even warmer than a microwave.

658
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,020
You seem fine.

659
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,100
What did you do to make Diao frustrated?

660
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,110
I don't know. I lost my memory.

661
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:00,110
You can't trick me.

662
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,630
You don't have to believe that I have amnesia.

663
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,910
I will make use of my amnesia
to uncover the truth.

664
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,310
That bulging-eyed dog, be careful,
or I'll turn you into meatballs.

665
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:10,330
Why would you scare her like that?

666
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:12,610
Even if you lost your memory...

667
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,730
Or...
