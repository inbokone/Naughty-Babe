00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,200
Did Kon Diao complain about the wedding

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,320
or discuss it with you?

5
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,560
Did Hia Yi send you to investigate me?

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,160
I don't think it'll ever be canceled.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,460
How did you come up with plans within plans
that will crash your own wedding?

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,410
You're about to engage in a battle,
but you have no idea who your enemy is.

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,780
You don't seem happy.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,370
You also didn't
before you went to Switzerland.

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,280
If it bothers you,
please walk away from it.

12
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,340
Is it all because of that

13
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,420
that our families must be
under this obligation?

14
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,120
You lost your childhood memories
because of me.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,840
Everyone uses you as a bargaining chip

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,430
to get what they want.

17
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,960
Whatever you want to do, do it.

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,820
If this marriage is a play,

19
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,170
then let's give it our all in every scene.

20
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,000
Starting today, I'll bring you happiness

21
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,640
and be your source of joy.

There's something I want your help with.

- Calm down. No need to rush.

Mr. Tacha, sir.

No need to rush.

45

Don't rush.

Hia...

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,890
Hey, where are you going?

48
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:36,810
It's so pretty.

49
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,970
Do you want to touch it?

50
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,370
I do, but...

51
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,210
Come on!

52
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,640
I can touch it now!

53
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,659
- I'm touching it.
- Good job! Give me a high five.

54
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:58,710
Yep!

55
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,140
- I'm touching it.
- Good job! Give me a high five.

56
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,610
Isn't Yi much cuter
when he was little than he is now?

57
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,650
Hello, Dad.

58
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,570
Let's go.

59
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,810
What can I do to help you today?

60
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,930
I've made a decisive decision.

61
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,210
I'll crash the wedding, Dad.

62
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,490
Crash? Why?

63
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,370
Please listen to me first. I can explain.

64
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,450
I want to try again.

65
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,130
I don't want to be just someone
who you and Hia have to protect.

66
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,810
I want to be by Hia's side.

67
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,770
Being by Yi's side is not easy, Diao.

68
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,770
I told you I would take care of him,

69
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,770
and I mean it.

70
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,250
I don't want you and Hia
to keep me out of every problem.

71
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,890
He deserves my protection, too.

72
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,810
I believe I can do it

73
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,090
if you give me the opportunity, Dad.

74
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,610
Why should I give you the opportunity

75
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,810
to crash my son's wedding?

76
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,130
If I'm able to crash the wedding,

77
00:06:56,409 --> 00:06:58,570
I'll be the one who breaches the contract.

78
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,930
The Wongteerawits will no longer
be able to use me as a bargaining chip

79
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,170
to take advantage of you and Hia.

80
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,890
The easiest way to crash the wedding is...

81
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,010
for me to run away.

82
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,290
Does Yi know about this?

83
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,210
He agreed.

84
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,290
The Chen family has paid too much
for the Wongteerawits, Dad.

85
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,050
It's not that we didn't get anything, Diao.

86
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,930
We paid the money to make up
for what happened to you.

87
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,650
The rest is business,

88
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,650
including racing track land

89
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,450
and having them as a partner
in an auto spare parts business.

90
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,409
As far as I'm concerned, it's not a loss.

91
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,930
But I don't like it

92
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,210
when my dad or the Wongteerawits

93
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,130
take advantage of you and Hia.

94
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,530
That's not the only problem.

95
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,890
They're your family, after all.

96
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,410
Therefore, I don't want there to be
a conflict in the future.

97
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,610
What do you advise me to do?

98
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,930
If you want my advice,

99
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,850
I'll say you don't have to be
cut off from your family.

100
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,130
Just make them do what they should.

101
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,850
You know it, right?

102
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:34,570
I and Sattha, your dad,

103
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,090
signed the first contract
when you were 7 years old.

104
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,289
We just signed another one
when you and Yi got engaged.

105
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,010
According to the contract,

106
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,850
if you two do not marry,

107
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,410
divorce within 5 years,

108
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,290
or have an affair,

109
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,250
and with the Chen family
being the ones breaking the contract,

110
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,970
we'll have to pay the Wongteerawits money
for the racing track.

111
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,730
But if the Wongteerawit family is at fault,

112
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:09,490
the land will belong to the Chen family.

113
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,170
However, if you insist

114
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,290
on crashing the wedding,

115
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,130
I have conditions for you.

116
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,570
Your plan will succeed

117
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,210
only if you can get away from my people.

118
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,570
I will not let you
run away that easily either.

119
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,050
Otherwise,
I'll be ashamed to meet my ancestors.

120
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,290
I'll give you 30 minutes.

121
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,890
Just 30 minutes?

122
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,370
30 minutes is enough

123
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:59,250
to make the Wongteerawits at fault
and compensate us

124
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,610
because you run away

125
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,970
and discredit us.

126
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,010
If you can do it,

127
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,570
you may do whatever you want about this.

128
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,330
But if you can't,

129
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,890
you have to let me and Yi handle it.

130
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,370
Okay, Dad.

131
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,650
Great.

132
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,010
You've got this, Tacha Chen.

133
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,890
I'm still one of the Wongteerawits, though.

134
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,850
Then, please excuse me.

135
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,490
Goodbye, Dad.

136
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,930
Wait, Diao.

137
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:21,570
I just want to tell you
that you still have your family here.

138
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,170
I welcomed you into the Chen family.

139
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,730
No matter how you handle the Wongteerawits,

140
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,170
you'll always be my son.

141
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,770
Okay, Dad.

142
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,170
Goodbye.

143
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,690
Whatever Nong Diao decides,

144
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,050
I'll be on his side.

145
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,850
Do you actually want to get married?

146
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,930
Don't just mess around.

147
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,730
I can't make it obvious.

148
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,890
In order for his plan to succeed,
I must pretend I know nothing about it.

149
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,490
Then, send your people after him.

150
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,530
After that, I'll tell him

151
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,050
that you forced me to get him back.

152
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,530
Damn you, Yi.

153
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,970
If you make mistakes this time,

154
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,770
I will sell all of the Chen family's assets

155
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,130
since we won't have any honor
or dignity left.

156
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,650
Don't make any mistakes.

157
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,530
Yes, Dad.

158
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,050
Great.

159
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,850
The job of the clan's chief

160
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,690
is to protect it, not to destroy it.

161
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,810
I'm not doing this only for him, Dad.

162
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,090
You know it.

163
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,850
It's a good thing
that you do it for someone you love.

164
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,850
Consider the advantages

165
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,050
as profit.

166
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,450
Yi.

167
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,650
Chen family members must be strong.

168
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,330
However,

169
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,570
strong people do cry.

170
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,690
If you want to cry, do so.

171
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,970
I'll be right here.

172
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,290
Dad...

173
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,210
You're amazing, Yi.

174
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,170
Thanks, Dad.

175
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,970
Yi...

176
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,370
Yes, Dad?

177
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,890
Is it tiring to be my son?

178
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,770
It's not as tiring as having me as a son.

179
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,550
Why don't the numbers match?

180
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,150
Why don't the figures
in the revenue summary by Sathaporn

181
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,510
match up with this one?

182
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,710
What happened to the money?

183
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,030
Get everyone in the accounting department
to my room now.

184
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,670
Bring the accounting documents
here as well.

185
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,270
Did you take care of everything?

186
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,070
Yes, sir.

187
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,270
Does Yi know about this yet?

188
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,310
He does, sir.

189
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,750
However, he doesn't know the details.

190
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,710
He will come to see you shortly, sir.

191
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,350
If they want to play those dirty tricks,

192
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,990
they'd better not blame us for being cruel.

193
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,070
Someone has been stalking me
for a while now.

194
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,430
It took a while
until they lost track of me.

195
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,630
You should hire
more security guards here, Dad.

196
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,070
I might not be the only one
they're stalking.

197
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,350
Who do they work for?

198
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,670
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

199
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:13,870
You're doing this again.

200
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,310
It's not that I didn't want
to use your people.

201
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,150
I didn't tell you
because they were just stalking me.

202
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,750
I wasn't sure.

203
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,430
I've sent someone, though.

204
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,030
Can I still ask for your help, Aon?

205
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,430
Do you still have time to work for me
if you also work for my dad?

206
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,990
Yi.

207
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,830
But you're still my first priority, sir.

208
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,750
I've been working for Mr. Makorn

209
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,270
since you got into an accident

210
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,550
because he's worried about you, sir.

211
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,510
You don't need to worry, sir.

212
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:55,550
I can still help you with anything.

213
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,870
Does that mean everything that I know...

214
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,590
I told you
you could use my stuff and people.

215
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,750
Is there anything else I don't know

216
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,310
besides the fact that
my secretary works for you?

217
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,510
Easy.

218
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,430
Listen to Aon's report first.

219
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,310
According to our engineer's report

220
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,910
on the car,

221
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:27,070
we discovered that...

222
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,390
Hello, Mr. Aon. I'm Nuea.

223
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,670
Someone used a piece of cloth
to plug the brake booster vacuum hose,

224
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,030
so the brake wasn't working.

225
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,830
After examining that piece of cloth

226
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,750
and the CCTV footage at your house,

227
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,270
the person who tampered
with Mr. Tacha's car was...

228
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,070
Mr. Tem of the Wongteerawits, sir.

229
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,910
How did he get into the house?

230
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,910
One of Mr. Makorn's guards...

231
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,830
also worked for them, sir.

232
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,230
That guard must have known

233
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,470
your guards' work schedule, sir.

234
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,510
Where the hell is he now?

235
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,070
We caught him
as he was trying to escape, sir.

236
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,870
He's now been brought back to the mansion.

237
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,750
He confessed

238
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,670
and blamed Mr. Tem
for giving him the money.

239
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:10,750
Easy.

240
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,910
Teach him a lesson
as per the Chen family's rules.

241
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,390
Yes, sir.

242
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,510
Only Tem?

243
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,350
Someone used Mr. Tem
to cause the accident, sir.

244
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,270
The actual wire-puller is...

245
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,470
Mr. Sathaporn Wongteerawit, sir.

246
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,710
He's Nong Diao's uncle.

247
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:53,990
Yes, sir.

248
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,030
I had no intention of killing Kon Diao.

249
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,470
How was I supposed to know
that Hia Yi would drive that car?

250
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,270
Did you do this alone, Mr. Tem?

251
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,150
Let me go!

252
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,990
My dad would never let you do this to me.

253
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,150
Even after he found out

254
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,030
you were going to injure Mr. Tacha?

255
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,590
Mr. Sattha...

256
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,950
doesn't know it yet, does he?

257
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,150
I didn't mean to do it.

258
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,670
Uncle Sathaporn made me do it.

259
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,110
Mr. Tem got used

260
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,470
because he thought Mr. Sattha...

261
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,670
would give Mr. Tacha
half of the Wongteerawit's land.

262
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,270
He, as a younger brother,
was worried he wouldn't get anything

263
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,590
because Mr. Sathaporn told him so.

264
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,230
And in fact, both Mr. Tem and Miss Tam...

265
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,670
are Mr. Sattha's biological children, sir.

266
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,590
They are not just his stepchildren,
as we first assumed.

267
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,590
As for Mrs. Orn, their mother,

268
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,990
in addition to having had
an affair with Mr. Sattha

269
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,270
since he was still married
to Mr. Tacha's mother,

270
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:48,150
she's now having an affair
with Mr. Sathaporn,

271
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,430
Mr. Sattha's younger brother

272
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,950
and the wire-puller for all of this.

273
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,270
Why did you get us here? Ouch!

274
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,630
- Let go of my daughter!
- It would be impossible

275
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,910
to claim that Mrs. Orn

276
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,150
was not involved in this.

277
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,070
Tem, why are you here?

278
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,990
Aon, why did you get my son here?

279
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:19,070
I have some questions for you,
Mrs. Orn, Miss Tam, and Mr. Tem,

280
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,310
regarding Mr. Sathaporn.

281
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:24,110
Then go ask him!

282
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,750
Why would you get us here?

283
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,750
Let go of me!

284
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,070
Where is that damn Sathaporn?

285
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,830
No more stalking the Chens.

286
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,390
Their weakness is the Wongteerawits.

287
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,310
Hunt Kon Diao down.

288
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,710
We'll see if you can catch me this time,
you damn Chens!

289
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,630
[Mr. Phayak Chatdecha Chen]

290
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:20,710
We still haven't found him.

291
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,750
Mr. Sathaporn was able to run away
from our people, sir.

292
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,150
Hire more guards.
Take good care of everyone.

293
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,080
Yes, sir.

294
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,230
Why are you here?

295
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,470
- Isn't Diao here with you?
- I'll just get straight to the point.

296
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,430
I don't know how you guys work.

297
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,510
A huge amount of money has vanished,

298
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,190
but you're still sitting around
doing nothing.

299
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,590
I just noticed it as well.

300
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,030
Someone's looking into it.

301
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,330
Right.

302
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,270
I don't want to be involved
in the private matters

303
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,670
of the Wongteerawits any longer

304
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,580
if it's not about my family.

305
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,140
I hope you can handle it.

306
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,180
However,
I wasn't here to only talk about this.

307
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,220
Sathaporn, your brother,

308
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,180
was behind my accident.

309
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,860
Not only Sathaporn,

310
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,100
but Orn, your current wife,

311
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,820
and Tem, your son,

312
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,260
were also involved.

313
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,260
What are you talking about?

314
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,380
See all the evidence for yourself.

315
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,060
It doesn't matter if you believe it or not.

316
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,480
The car that overturned was given
to Nong Diao by my dad

317
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,580
as an engagement gift.

318
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,700
Do you remember that?

319
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,260
Tem also does.

320
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,970
The person who tampered with the car
was Tem.

321
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,540
This is impossible.

322
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,420
Tem wouldn't do that.

323
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,380
They're siblings.

324
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,460
Are you sure

325
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,500
that siblings wouldn't hurt each other?

326
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,140
I'd like you to do me a favor.

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,740
Don't tell Kon Diao anything yet.

328
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,300
I'll handle all of this.

329
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,220
I will not let Kon Diao hurt again,

330
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,980
no matter why or who,

331
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,980
even if that person
is his biological father.

- Let me go! Let go of me!!
- Catch him!

Stay still!

336
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:09,940
A group of people
was following Mr. Tacha, sir.

337
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,220
What?

338
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,620
However,
he's now safe with your guards, sir.

339
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,580
And we've captured them, sir.

[Nong Diao]

342
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,060
Hello, Nong Diao.

343
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,300
Where are you? Are you alright?

344
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,620
I'm alright, Hia.

345
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,380
Do you know who they are?

346
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,460
I'm not sure.

347
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,300
However, I'm fine.

348
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,500
Mr. Chenne helped me
before it was too late.

Hey! Run!

Hey! Run! Come on!

359
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,900
Your dad's guards and your guards
are now chasing them down.

Where are you? I'll be right there.

Calm down, Hia.

Don't worry about me.

Okay. Don't be scared.

366
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,820
My guards just informed me
that they'd captured them.

Okay, Hia. Thank you.

can I pick you up?

00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,380
I'm not at ease.

371
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,820
It's alright, Hia.

372
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,420
You don't have to worry about me.

I'll get something done first.

See you at home.

We've found out where Sathaporn is going.

Get the car.

You don't have to. I'll handle this.

383
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,860
I raised you to be a businessman,

384
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,300
not a thug.

385
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,660
Just keep your hands off of this.

386
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:41,620
I can't.

00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,020
You can't handle it your way.

388
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,700
You just told me

389
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,340
you didn't raise me to be a thug.

390
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,980
I will handle this.

391
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,260
I will never let anyone, no matter who,

Don't spoil him too much.

If he's intractable, you can come back
and work for me at the mansion.

396
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,940
I still want to help
and work for Mr. Phayak, sir.

Just forget what happened
and don't think of it as indebtedness.

Although Yi helped you
when your father passed away,

400

don't forget that he passed away

401
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,660

Actually, you don't have to take me home.

I've never wanted it.

You've never asked me what I wanted

If you are sorry,

you should be able to tell me
what you're sorry for.

00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,880
I'm not going to pull my punches.

496
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:34,800
You'd better keep your guard up then,
Tacha Chen.

497
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:37,600
Hia Yi's guards are now
at every exit.

498
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:39,160
You have to be very careful.

499
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,920
Kon Diao just walked past me.

500
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,120
Why didn't you stop him?

501
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:43,400
If I did, it wouldn't be fun.

502
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,440
Jeez, this a**hole!

503
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:48,640
I will not let you run away from me
ever again.

504
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,400
Please stay with me

505
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,040
and let me love you.

506
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,160
I will never let you down.

507
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,920
I will always love you, Kon Diao,

508
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,720
and my love for you will last forever.
