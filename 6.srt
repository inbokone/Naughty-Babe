3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,480
Dad, why would the Chen family help us?

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,610
You're happy, right?

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,630
That's enough.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,370
I'm not sure what you know

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,890
or what you want from the Chen family.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,020
Even if they get married,

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,050
we can't guarantee that we can get more money from the Chen family.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,860
We can invest.

If anything happens to Diao this time,

12
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,020
I'll really kick you out of the Chen family.

13
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,210
You let my mom go. I think I can continue to put up with it.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,560
Maybe I should let him go.

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,170

It was finished a long time ago.

56

I'm gonna take a look too.

60
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,320
look at this tomorrow morning.

61
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,060
Do you want to look at it alone?

62
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,790
Don't you want me to look at it with you?

63
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,880
You don't trust my taste. Is that it?

64
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,880
It's not like that.

65
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,910
This was finished long ago.

66
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,270
But I've never seen you look at it.

67
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,190
I thought you weren't interested in this.

68
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,260
It's not that I'm not interested.

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,320
Back then, I wanted you to choose what you like.

70
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:44,770
Besides,

71
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,410
I'm jealous.

72
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:51,790
Really?

73
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,350
My bad.

74
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,970
I didn't tell you my thoughts.

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,850
That's why you misunderstood me.

76
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,590
I didn't ask you, Yi.

77
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,880
I was worried that you might dislike me.

78
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,750
So it was my fault too.

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,630
From now on, let's communicate more.

80
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,830
Okay?

81
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,260
Okay.

82
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,900
Let's choose together, okay?

83
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:34,900
Okay.

84
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,950
Yi.

85
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,480
Can I ask you some questions?

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,630
Of course.

87
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,950
Didn't we just agree

88
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,580
to communicate more?

89
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,440
When I was 7,

90
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,980
you and I...

91
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,710
I remember I was happy

92
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,450
because my dad took me to a big house.

93
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,159
I had a playmate.

94
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,960
He's a very kind brother.

95
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,990
How much do you remember?

96
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,020
I remember the big house

97
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,440
had a butterfly wind chime in front of the door.

98
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,220
There was a big garden in the house.

99
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,120
I was playing with you.

100
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,970
You disappeared.

101
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,900
Then I saw a tiger.

102
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,030
Lele.

103
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,790
It was my tiger.

104
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,180
I was going to take it to you,

105
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,280
but it escaped.

106
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,500
I thought I could keep an eye on it.

107
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,590
The person who looked after the tiger warned me.

108
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,920
Even though your body wasn't hurt,

109
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,050
your heart was hurt badly.

110
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,810
You've lost your childhood memories because of me.

111
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,530
Even if I take care of you for the rest of your life,

112
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,120
I can't make up for what you've been through.

113
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,410
Lele was taken away.

114
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,620
It was all my fault.

115
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,310
Yi,

116
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,020
I'm sorry.

117
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,640
If I weren't there that day...

118
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,010
Diao,

119
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,740
you shouldn't have said sorry.

120
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,550
I,

121
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,040
my dad,

122
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:56,480
and Wongtheerawit should apologize.

123
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,210
We made you like this.

124
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,610
That accident

125
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,530
is the reason for everything today.

126
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,270
Everyone thinks this is for your good.

127
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,300
To get what they want,

128
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,290
they treat you as a tool.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,720
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,520
From today on,

131
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,039
let me make you happy.

132
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,480
Where is my happiness?

133
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,060
I want you to be happy too.

134
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,780
Let me

135
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,280
make you happy.

136
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,330
Today,

137
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,690
let me make you happy.

138
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,920
Let me "take care of" you.

139
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,880
It won't hurt.

140
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,070
Kuea,

141
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,900
did Kondiao complain to you or negotiate with you about the wedding?

142
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,540
Did Yi ask you to ask about it?

143
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,540
No.

144
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,170
I'm just worried.

145
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,800
People may think too much before the wedding,

146
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,340
especially Kondiao.

147
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,340
Why are you worried about that?

148
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,050
They will get married anyway.

149
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,050
Diao has been waiting for 3 years.

150
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,880
I don't think it'll go wrong no matter what.

151
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,920
Did you say "go wrong"?

152
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,040
I was just saying.

153
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,330
Nothing.

154
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,980
Just confess.

155
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,150
What's the plan of you and Kondiao?

156
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,270
Nothing.

157
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,440
I don't have a plan.

158
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:48,890
Really?

159
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,110
Why are you so close to me?

160
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,030
Do you want me to give you a facial massage?

161
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,520
Fine.

162
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,030
Kuea,

163
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,760
didn't you say you would tell me everything?

164
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,290
Are you hiding something from me?

165
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,020
Do you really want me to do "something good" to you before you tell me?

166
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,340
You're making me sad.

167
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,510
Lian,

168
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,700
I really can't tell you.

169
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,910
I promised Kondiao.

170
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,550
Look.

171
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,010
You really have a plan.

172
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,280
Have you realized your mistake?

173
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,500
I love you,

174
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,640
but I love Kondiao too.

175
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,570
I won't tell you no matter what you do.

176
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,220
Hm.

177
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,780
You are so stubborn.

178
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,370
I'm really gonna get angry.

179
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,800
You'll be happy after I coax you.

180
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,620
Mr. Kuea Keerati, you're too confident.

181
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:00,060
Mr. Kilen, don't think that I'll do everything as you say.

182
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:04,280
Did you do as I said?

183
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,510
But seriously,

184
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,140
if anything goes wrong with the plan of you and Kondiao,

185
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,290
I hope you can stay out of their business.

186
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,190
Are you saying I'm nosy?

187
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,290
That's not what I meant.

188
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,530
I just want to say they should deal with their own problems.

189
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,840
Have you heard about this?

190
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,420
They say people who lie in bed and chat

191
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,700
are different from those who sit and chat.

192
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,230
Then how long are you going to sit and chat with me?

193
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,070
Let's lie down and chat, okay?

194
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,620
Kuea.

195
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,440
Don't change the topic. I'm really worried about you.

196
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:46,750
Humph.

197
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,860
You're not worried about me.

198
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,340
You're more worried about your friend.

199
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,880
Why?

200
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,150
You're just worried that Kondiao's plan will succeed, right?

201
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,990
Why are you getting worse, little Annabel?

202
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,450
Let's make a bet.

203
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,260
Just for fun.

204
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:08,410
The one who loses has to listen to the winner.

205
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,800
Kuea, we shouldn't make a bet on our friends' life for fun.

206
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,140
Then let's be serious.

207
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,910
To be honest, considering what Kondiao has felt and what he wants,

208
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,660
he's not joking with Yi.

209
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,430
Fine.

210
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:25,069
Annabel, just wait. You'll lose.

211
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,540
Lian.

212
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:43,540
Lian.

213
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,250
Enough.

214
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,160
I don't want to drink a lot today.

215
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,330
Why? Are you under a lot of pressure?

216
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,050
We need to be more careful these days.

217
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,820
The Chen family is investigating things about Wongtheerawit.

218
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,660
Investigating?

219
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,080
Investigating what?

220
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:26,940
I don't know.

221
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,640
But it'll be bad if they find out about us during the investigation.

222
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,580
How can they find it out?

223
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,370
It's been over 20 years.

224
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,370
And most importantly,

225
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,700
that old man doesn't know yet.

226
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,730
My brother is a fool,

227
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,790
but Makorn is not stupid.

228
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,110
You have to be careful.

229
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,270
Besides,

230
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,500
we need to keep a distance from each other these days.

231
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,340
Should we separate?

232
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,280
How long?

233
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,720
At least

234
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,710
we have to wait until the Chen family writes a new agreement to negotiate.

235
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,150
A marriage agreement?

236
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,480
Yes.

237
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,430
Then we can get a lot of benefits.

238
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,210
Let's lay low for a while.

239
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,700
Soon,

240
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,460
everything of Wongtheerawit and the Chen family will be ours.

241
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:43,540
You know what? You're not the only one who had nightmares about that day.

242
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,420
I couldn't sleep either.

243
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,150
Did you start to have nightmares from that day on?

244
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,210
Was it because of me?

245
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,800
I told you it wasn't because of you.

246
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,590
I was just a kid back then.

247
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:02,820
I was very scared.

248
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,300
I've been hiding what happened that day in my heart till today.

249
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,210
Is that when the torture started?

250
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,540
I'm telling you this

251
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,790
because I don't want you

252
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,090
to be worried when you see I can't fall asleep.

253
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,380
I don't want you to be burdened with it

254
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,980
or think about it alone.

255
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,770
But if this is the problem...

256
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,410
Let's solve it together.

257
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,690
Okay.

258
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,100
Yi, I want to know one more thing.

259
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,100
What is it?

260
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,630
Is this all because of that?

261
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,720
Is that why the two families are intertwined?

262
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,420
After what happened that day,

263
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,470
you almost died because of me.

264
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,660
You lost your memories.

265
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,170
My dad wanted to be responsible for everything and make it up to your family.

266
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,920
So he drafted the cooperation agreement between the two families.

267
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,230
It involves business

268
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,600
and what the Chen family has to be responsible for.

269
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,920
Responsible for everything?

270
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,090
What does it include?

271
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,430
Medical expenses,

272
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,110
compensation,

273
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,590
and child care expenses.

274
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,660
Is there anything else after we were engaged?

275
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,660
Just monthly living expenses.

276
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,430
The agreement has additional terms.

277
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,280
That's why my dad used me to gain benefits from the Chen family.

278
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,820
I'm fine now.

279
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,820
Why should you pay?

280
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,170
What about my trip to the U.K.?

281
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:21,460
Was it my dad?

282
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,330
No.

283
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,990
My dad wanted to make you break up with your family

284
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,820
and wait for the benefits.

285
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,050
Yi, tell me.

286
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,530
Has my dad ever loved me?

287
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,180
Thank you

288
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,020
for always protecting me.

289
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,920
Diao.

290
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,150
Thank you

291
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,250
for not letting go of me.

292
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,660
I won't be controlled by Wongtheerawit anymore.

293
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,080
I want to have my own life.

294
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,260
I don't want to be a Wongtheerawit member anymore.

295
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,680
Do you want to be a member of the Chen family?

296
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,620
Before you become a member of the Chen family,

297
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,470
why don't we take a shower?

298
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,910
Okay.

299
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,570
Okay.

300
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,640
What are you doing?

301
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,830
If you have something good, you should share it with me.

302
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,770
Is this your good thing?

303
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,010
Are you sure it's not a water bottle?

304
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,370
You're just on the top. It doesn't mean you're the best.

305
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,990
Maybe others can also do what you can do.

306
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,280
What are you talking about, Tam?

307
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,000
Dad.

308
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,300
I told you

309
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,470
not to touch the wine.

310
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,890
They are expensive.

311
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,960
Dad, you put the wine here. If they are not for drinking, why did you put them here?

312
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,220
Idiot. The longer you put them, the more expensive they are.

313
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,270
Right, Dad?

314
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,680
It's okay. Let him be.

315
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,220
You need to tell me if you want to drink next time.

316
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,820
I don't like sneaky people.

317
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,190
Okay.

318
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,870
Dad, I said I want to invest in that brand.

319
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,560
How's it going?

320
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,810
I haven't thought about that yet.

321
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,940
I've been busy

322
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,740
with Kondiao's things.

323
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,610
Think about it as soon as possible.

324
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,380
The price is just right.

325
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,920
If I don't buy it now, I might miss the chance.

326
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,000
Okay, I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

327
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,760
Really? Thank you, Dad.

328
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,530
I love you the most.

329
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,550
Have you made money from her designer bags?

330
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,700
Let her be.

331
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,310
She's also working to support herself.

332
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,140
What about my car maintenance business?

333
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:00,750
How about this?

334
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,770
Ask your brother to talk to Yi first.

335
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,140
Ask him to help. You go explain everything.

336
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,030
That's all I can do for you.

337
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,810
Yi, don't mess with my stuff.

338
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,930
Kondiao,

339
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,030
why did you put things in the box?

340
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,580
Why don't you display them?

341
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,990
To whom?

342
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,740
Just put them here.

343
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,280
You won a competition, right?

344
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,150
Don't you feel proud?

345
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,990
I can just put the sense of pride in my heart.

346
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,680
I plan to quit anyway.

347
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,010
Do you plan to go to Switzerland to raise cows?

348
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,850
I don't think I'll really go there to raise cows.

349
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,850
I'll go there to take a look first

350
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,130
and see what I can do.

351
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,480
If you don't go to Switzerland,

352
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,820
stay in Thailand,

353
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,630
and abandon everything,

354
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,040
what do you want to do?

355
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,670
In terms of a job,

356
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,980
I love being a coach.

357
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,040
I like being with kids.

358
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,540
If I have more time to practice,

359
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,530
I want to get the Level 5 certificate.

360
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,270
Okay.

361
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,560
Just do it.

362
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:30,060
Can I?

363
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:37,290
Yes.

364
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,680
I will help you

365
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,930
accomplish everything you want to do.

366
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,650
As long as you ask,

367
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,690
I will do everything for you.

368
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,620
Yi.

369
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,490
Because I love you.

370
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,420
I won't hide it.

371
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,840
I want you to see it every minute.

372
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,300
Don't hide it in the box.

373
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,880
And I hope you can allow me

374
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,720
to see

375
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,410
what else is in your heart.

376
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,570
There's something I...

377
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,170
I have been hiding.

378
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,290
What is it?

379
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,140
Love.

380
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,080
What is it again?

381
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,910
I didn't hear it.

382
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,150
I love you.

383
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,980
I love you so much.

384
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,130
I love you too.

385
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,980
Everyone, line up.

386
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,280
I have something to tell you today.

387
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,170
What I want to say is...

388
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,480
is...

389
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,500
is...

390
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,730
is...

391
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,350
Mr. Kondiao is back.

392
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,180
I'm back for you.

393
00:30:59,180 --> 00:30:59,840
Welcome.

394
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,030
All right, everyone.

395
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,710
Let's keep practicing hard.

396
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,140
Line up.

397
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:12,980
Attention.

398
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:15,630
Bow.

399
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,560
Ready.

400
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,080
Horse stance.

401
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,950
One.

402
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,380
One.

403
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,320
One punch.

404
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,060
-One.
-Ah.

405
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,810
Two.

406
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,680
Ah.

407
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,080
Three.

408
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,020
Ah.

409
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,360
Four.

410
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,330
Ah.

411
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:32,670
Five.

412
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,790
Ah.

413
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,850
Ready.

414
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,080
Good job, everyone.

415
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,340
Mr. Kondiao.

416
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,170
Mr. Chian.

417
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,530
Have you come back to teach again?

418
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,120
Yes, I just came back today.

419
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,740
Does that mean you'll come often?

420
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,280
I'm not sure.

421
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,600
I think so. They need a teacher today.

422
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,240
The school contacted me and asked me to come back to teach.

423
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,670
Then I'll be honest with you.

424
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,570
I asked the school to contact you and ask you to come back to teach.

425
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,320
After we met in my house last time,

426
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,190
Chun kept crying and looking for you.

427
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,820
So I asked Mr. Winner to contact you.

428
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,380
I'm glad you came back to teach.

429
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,700
And...

430
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,230
I almost lost my hope.

431
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,490
Okay.

432
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,390
Mr. Kondiao. Dad.

433
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,090
Chun.

434
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:10,040
Dad, Mr. Kondiao taught me today.

435
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,280
It was great, right?

436
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:15,140
Yes, Dad. It was great. Mr. Kondiao is amazing.

437
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,940
Then let's invite Mr. Kondiao to have a meal together. What do you think?

438
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,460
Okay.

439
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,250
Mr. Kondiao.

440
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,040
Can you go have a meal with me?

441
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,210
I can't go.

442
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,340
I have to go home and eat with the man I'm engaged to.

443
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,030
It was fine in the past.

444
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,690
Or are you worried that Mr. Yi might scold you?

445
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,790
Should I call him?

446
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,420
It's not like that.

447
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,080
You don't look happy at all.

448
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,150
You didn't look happy either before going to Switzerland.

449
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,720
If you feel upset and uncomfortable,

450
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,520
just come out.

451
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:00,860
Let's go.

452
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,790
I found a new Omakase Japanese restaurant. It has Japanese chefs.

453
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,390
They have great cooking skills.

454
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,219
You misunderstood.

455
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,750
I'm very happy now.

456
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,480
The only place I want to go back for dinner

457
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,500
is my home where Yi is waiting for me.

458
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,449
Excuse me.

459
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,250
Then why do you want to go to Switzerland?

460
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,920
Are you sure you are happy now?

461
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,520
Don't think I'm nosy.

462
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,690
I can see that.

463
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,340
You can be happier than now.

464
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,100
It depends on whether you're willing to open your heart.

465
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,910
Yes.

466
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,090
I've opened my heart.

467
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,020
Only Yi can walk into my heart.

468
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:13,280
If I have to make a choice

469
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,280
between opening my heart to someone else and living without Yi,

470
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,020
I will choose to live without Yi.

471
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,010
Because Yi is my source of happiness. Not everyone can do that.

472
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Sorry.

473
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,780
Aon, help me handle my work schedule.

474
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,780
If a representative can do my work, ask a representative to do it.

475
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,180
Cancel all my social activities with my friends.

476
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,810
I want to spend more time with Kondiao.

477
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,150
The wedding is the top priority.

478
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,030
Okay, Boss.

479
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,190
I'm gonna call Mr. Lian to cancel the appointment at Pentagon tonight.

480
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,490
No. The appointment tonight is very important.

481
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,330
I have to meet Lian. In terms of other things, do as I said.

482
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,720
Thank you.

483
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:38,640
Okay, Boss.

484
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,480
Oh.

485
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,030
Didn't he say he'd come back to have dinner together?

486
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,030
Hello, Yi.

487
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,830
When will you come back tonight?

488
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,720
I have something to talk with Lian at Pentagon.

489
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,280
Okay.

490
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,140
What a pity. You missed.

491
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,140
My arm hurts.

492
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:03,950
Really?

493
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,790
I was just going to praise you for doing a good job.

494
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,370
Watch your mouth.

495
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:09,460
Be careful.

496
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:11,110
Come on.

497
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,090
Show me.

498
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,190
Like this?

499
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,500
Brag when you can do it, stupid Yi.

500
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,120
Stupid Lian, you're really good at bragging.

501
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,720
Why have I made friends with someone who's good at bragging like you?

502
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,580
Because you love me, bro.

503
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,220
More precisely,

504
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,520
I'm your only friend.

505
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,770
I have other friends.

506
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,400
But no one can share wisdom with you like me.

507
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,360
Thank you very much.

508
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:08,020
Of course. Do you know why you have a friend like me?

509
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:09,670
Why?

510
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,310
Because you're stupid, stupid Yi.

511
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,370
Stupid Lian. Why did you swear at me for no reason?

512
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,240
Because you are stupid.

513
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,590
And you still won't admit it.

514
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:24,570
If you didn't have a friend like me, you wouldn't have gone this far.

515
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,020
What are you trying to say?

516
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,620
-Just say it.
-What are you thinking? You plan to ruin your wedding.

517
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:31,960
I have to do it.

518
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,070
It won't be a problem even if you plan to do it.

519
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:36,070
The point is you have to figure out who your enemy is.

520
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,340
If you plan to fight, but you don't know your enemy,

521
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,510
you'll only fail.

522
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,390
How can I not know?

523
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,520
I've known Kondiao for more than 20 years.

524
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,180
Then do you know

525
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,390
who Kondiao has invited to be his best men?

526
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,020
Kuea.

527
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,470
Not just Kuea.

528
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:52,800
See?

529
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,990
I told you you're stupid, stupid Yi.

530
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,440
Who?

531
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,660
Kondiao's best men are

532
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:02,660
AKA Ironman Gang.

533
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:03,940
They are...

534
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,970
The last one, Kirin,

535
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,870
is a world-renowned artist worth $15 million.

536
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,670
Enough, Lian. I don't want to hear you flatter your lover.

537
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,090
Why do Kondiao have four best men?

538
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,990
What about me? Who do I have?

539
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,960
When something like this happens, I want to quit being your friend.

540
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,040
No way.

541
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:02,810
You have to stay and help me.

542
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,800
[Okay, everyone. Our plan is top-secret. Don't tell anyone else.]

543
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,700
Especially Lian.

544
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:23,960
[Especially Yi.]

545
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,060
What, Kuea?

546
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,700
You're defending Lian again.

547
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,270
This is quite interesting.

548
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,720
Let them think we know nothing first.

549
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,480
And then we can launch a counterattack on these naughty kids.

550
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,070
Kondiao and Kuea must be taught a lesson.

551
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,270
Let them know

552
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,730
they can't be naughty in front of us.

553
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,210
Okay. Ready.

554
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,820
Look at the camera.

555
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,170
Good. Three, 2.

556
00:41:58,930 --> 00:41:59,940
Smile.

557
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,040
One, 2.

558
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,020
Smile. Three, 2.

559
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,480
Very handsome.

560
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,150
Mr. Phayak, smile.

561
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,400
Please wait a moment.

562
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,330
Yi, do tigers not smile easily?

563
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:27,470
I think I smiled.

564
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,660
No, your expression was like this.

565
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,760
Me? No way.

566
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,530
Really.

567
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,190
You looked like you were forced here to take photos.

568
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,500
If I display the photos,

569
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,390
people will think you are forced to get married.

570
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,560
I'm not good at it.

571
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,220
Let's do it again.

572
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,430
Okay.

573
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:56,810
Everyone.

574
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,140
We are ready.

575
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:03,890
Ready.

576
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,330
Smile. Three, 2.

577
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,330
Three, 2.

578
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,210
Mr. Phayak, a bigger smile please.

579
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,810
Yi, it's not natural at all.

580
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,690
If you can't do it, try to say "cheese", okay?

581
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:30,990
"Cheese"?

582
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,800
"Cheese".

583
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:36,940
"Cheese".

584
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:40,770
"Cheese".

585
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,060
You want me to do it?

586
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,790
Yi, it's easy. Use your fingers like this. "Cheese".

587
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,280
-It's not difficult at all. "Cheese".
-"Cheese".

588
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,030
Yi, you look cute like this.

589
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,720
"Cheese".

590
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:18,930
We're ready.

591
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:20,700
Okay.

592
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,250
One, 2.

593
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,030
"Cheese".

594
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:30,490
"Cheese".

595
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,600
Okay, let's call it a day. Thank you.

596
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,290
Okay, thank you.

597
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:49,920
Yi,

598
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:54,740
my friends and I will have a bachelor party at Kuea's place tonight.

599
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,070
Let me take you there.

600
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:02,830
Oh. It's okay.

601
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,060
I can go by myself.

602
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,980
Are you going to ride a bike again?

603
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,500
I'll pick you up.

604
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,670
Yi, it's okay.

605
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,510
I don't know when it'll be over.

606
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,350
Yi, have a good rest.

607
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,060
I'm worried about you.

608
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,410
Don't worry about me.

609
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,110
Just tonight.

610
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,780
After this, I won't go to any party anymore.

611
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,300
This is what you said about pretending we're really getting married, right?

612
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Whatever.

613
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,500
Do whatever you want.

614
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,660
You sound like you don't want me to go.

615
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,270
It's just a bachelor party.

616
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:42,130
It's really nothing.

617
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:45,050
You should know what it is.

618
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,470
If this marriage is like a play,

619
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,260
let's do our best in every scene.

620
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:30,800
Everyone,

621
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:32,630
listen.

622
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,610
Once the music is played,

623
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,830
this door will open.

624
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,440
We take Yi to the hall.

625
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,400
When the door opens,

626
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,400
Yi will say "oh, Kondiao".

627
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:44,760
"Where is Kondiao"?

628
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,680
And the guests will start to panic. While they are panic,

629
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:49,450
Winner, Jiew,

630
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,590
go to the door and lock the door. Bang.

631
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,010
And In, take this opportunity

632
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,580
to run to the power supply room and cut off electricity in the whole building.

633
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,350
After the power is cut off, bang,

634
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:01,700
Kondiao,

635
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:03,240
it'll be your turn.

636
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,390
Run to the elevator

637
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,390
and go to the roof.

638
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,700
When you arrive at the roof, go to the heliport.

639
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,130
I'll wait for you there.

640
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,800
What do you think? Is my plan cool?

641
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,500
The elevator won't be available if the power is cut off.

642
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,140
Also,

643
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,240
there will be bodyguards and security guards of the Chen family everywhere

644
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,070
at the wedding.

645
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,160
There are only five of us. This is a big plan. I don't think it will work.

646
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,420
Haha. In the end, Kondiao still has to go back and get married.

647
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:36,520
What do you mean?

648
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,660
Why did you let me talk for so long?

649
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,490
I thought my plan was great.

650
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,950
Who else can come up with another plan?

651
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,840
Kondiao, what do you think? Do you have an idea?

652
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:57,820
Kondiao.

653
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,250
Kondiao.

654
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,010
Are you listening? I'm asking you.

655
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,620
That's good.

656
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:05,750
Let's do it according to this plan.

657
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,990
Let me talk to Kondiao.

658
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,880
You have to pull yourself together.

659
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:30,880
What's on your mind?

660
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,950
I'm not sure.

661
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,580
Not sure?

662
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,230
Are you worried that the plan won't work?

663
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,980
No.

664
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,040
I'm worried about Yi.

665
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,600
I'm afraid if the plan succeeds,

666
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,270
Yi will be very sad.

667
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:58,060
I don't know which is the right choice.

668
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:03,640
Should I marry Yi or leave him quietly?

669
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,780
I don't have to go to Switzerland.

670
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,070
I can go somewhere else.

671
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,430
I can go somewhere further than that place,

672
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,630
and it will be harder to find me.

673
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,180
But what will happen to Yi?

674
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:24,080
Kuea, I'm worried that Yi will be heart-broken.

675
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:41,340
It's okay.

676
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,340
Take your time.

677
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,270
There must be a way.

[Preview of the next episode]

680
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,390
Dad, the Chen family has given too much compensation to Wongteerawit.

681
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:41,790
I'll protect Yi too.

682
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:45,950
The easiest way to ruin the wedding is for me to run away.

683
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:48,710
If you want to run away as you've planned,

684
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,370
you have to escape from my men first.

685
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:54,030
If Kondiao's plan is good, I'll pretend I know nothing.

686
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:55,670
You have to make sure nothing will go wrong.

687
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,460
Someone has been following me for a while.

688
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,560
I finally got rid of them.

689
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,300
Dad, you need more bodyguards here. Maybe I'm not the only one who has been followed.

690
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:02,580
I won't do that.

691
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,860
They're brothers.

692
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,860
No matter what the reason is or who he is,

693
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,580
it won't make a difference even if he's Kondiao's biological father.

694
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,780
I won't let Kondiao suffer anymore.
