They are so lonely that sometimes I feel sorry for them.

I thought I was close to the true colors of Yi.

We met when I was 18.

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,419
Back then, I didn't know what it meant to be treated as part of him.

28
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,210
Everyone said he needed to take care of me

because I was important.

To him, this is not love.

It's not even kindness, but a duty.

Where else can I go?

121
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,530
Then why did you come out of the press conference alone?

122
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,180
I didn't feel well.

123

Yes.

142
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,090
But it took a lot of time.

143

The puppy

145
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:38,720
happened to be quite aloof.

146
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,810
Puppy! Puppy! Don't run!

147
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,830
Puppy, come back here.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,380
Oh, no.

149
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,680
It's good that it got away. It is ruthless.

150
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,960
Puppy! Puppy!

151
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,090
It is also a threat to me.

152
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,360
It has such a temperament

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,020
because Diao has always spoiled it.

154
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,070
Puppy! Puppy! Don't run!

155
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,010
Puppy!

156
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,240
Wait.

157
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,250
When the security guard went to catch the dog, where was Diao?

158
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,860
The security guard said Mr. Tacha went to the bathroom.

159
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,100
Mr. Tacha.

160
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,860
I've sent your dog back.

161
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,760
Go.

162
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,210
Well...

163
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Mr. Tacha. Are you okay?

164
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,290
I'll get going then.

165
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,550
So he didn't see him?

166
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,860
Then why aren't the cameras at home working?

167
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,370
Because the dog played with wires,

168
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,990
the wires are broken.

169
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,510
Diao lied.

170
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,340
Well...

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,340
Why?

172
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,540
Diao treats the dog like his ancestor.

173
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,590
He can't bear for the dog to be bitten by mosquitoes.

174
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,110
Diao wouldn't allow this dog

175
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,110
to run away or bite wires.

176
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,380
But

177
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,790
the security guard said Mr. Tacha had diarrhea.

178
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,270
That's right.

179
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,150
Diao has never...

180
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,030
Never farted.

181
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,590
He doesn't fart.

182
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,010
He never farts in front of others. He cares about it.

183
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,080
Aren't you going to serve your dad?

184
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,410
Go down and find him.

185
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,270
Where is your boss?

186
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,490
But since you're still here, he won't go far.

187
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,800
Or did he abandon you?

188
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,720
Sorry.

189
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,810
The subscriber you dialed can not be reached.

190
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,520
What's going on?

191
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,000
Udon!

192
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,190
Diao is missing.

193
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,570
Find him now!

194
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,530
Does he realize that I'm gone?

195
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,800
He probably doesn't yet.

196
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,320
He's so busy.

197
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,450
He even forgot

198
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,620
someone was waiting for him.

199
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,200
It's been like this since I was 18.

200
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,170
Time goes fast.

201
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,820
But for me,

202
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,410
it's been a long time, Yi.

203
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,090
For over 6,000 nights, I had the same nightmare over and over again.

204
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,040
For three years, there has been a question that I've been hesitant to ask, bothering me.

205
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,320
I was afraid that the truth would change everything.

206
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,900
There is hope, yet I have to repeatedly face disappointment.

207
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,250
-It's tiring and discouraging.
-Thank you.

208
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,420
When I realized it again, those feelings had become normal.

209
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,550
Even though it's not normal,

210
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,650
and sometimes, I want to have the courage to ask you directly

211
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:06,240
whether there's something wrong.

212
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,819
What happened to our love?

213
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,140
[2023]

214
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,500
Yi.

215
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,550
-Thank you.
-Okay.

216
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,090
Eat up.

217
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,820
Why are you staring at my face?

218
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,140
Is there something on my face?

219
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,360
It's cute.

220
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,810
Are you kidding me?

221
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,980
Do you like this house?

222
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,550
Yes.

223
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,660
But you should come here often to sleep.

224
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,620
You've been acting strange lately

225
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,660
ever since Kuea and Lian's wedding,

226
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,790
Maybe it's because you got the bouquet.

227
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,220
I can't get married alone.

228
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,060
You need to want to get married too.

229
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,670
Or should we get engaged first?

230
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,440
Nowadays, some people get engaged in the morning and married in the evening.

231
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,560
What about honeymoon?

232
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,610
I'm a businessman. I need to know the whole situation

233
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,560
before I know what to do.

234
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,890
Yi. You're great.

235
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,390
Do you want a child?

236
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,900
You mean adopting a child?

237
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,780
Yes.

238
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,040
I didn't think that far.

239
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,450
Besides,

240
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,710
I already have Puppy.

241
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,480
So where are we going for our honeymoon?

242
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,130
Anywhere.

243
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,980
Where there's you.

244
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,000
Then here.

245
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,530
Is it okay now?

246
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,690
Switzerland. Yi.

247
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,130
I want to travel to Switzerland.

248
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,660
Why Switzerland?

249
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,630
I want to go to Mount Alps to see cows.

250
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,270
There are cows everywhere.

251
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,090
That's different. Yi.

252
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,770
Cows from Mount Alps

253
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,690
live in a place with fresh air.

254
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,280
There are beautiful grass fields and freedom.

255
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,130
And their horns

256
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,970
are very beautiful.

257
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,330
I thought

258
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,940
if I could choose what to reincarnate into in my next life,

259
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,970
I want to be a cow on Mount Alps.

260
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,940
Are you serious?

261
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,470
Of course.

262
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,290
That's why I don't eat beef.

263
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,440
When I was in England, I talked to my friends many times,

264
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,260
but I couldn't go there for a reason every time.

265
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,690
What are the reasons?

266
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,340
Why didn't I know about these before?

267
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,540
For the first time,

268
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,220
there was a snowstorm.

269
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,280
I put up with it.

270
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,490
For the second time,

271
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,270
Kuea had a fever.

272
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,290
I put up with it.

273
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,460
As for the third time,

274
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,030
I was almost there.

275
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,770
But my wallet was stolen.

276
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,730
Kuea lent me money.

277
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,170
But I felt sorry.

278
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,370
Kuea didn't go either.

279
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,230
That's why

280
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,060
I've never been there.

281
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,550
I didn't know

282
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,760
you'd been through these before.

283
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,260
There are a lot of things

284
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,520
I've been through with Kuea.

285
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,580
Okay.

286
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,190
Switzerland is fine.

287
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,570
I'll take you there later.

288
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,830
Okay.

289
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,580
But don't tell Kuea.

290
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,720
Otherwise, they two will follow us.

291
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,500
Okay, Yi. It's okay.

292
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,060
Yi.

293
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,540
What're you doing?

294
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,420
I want to try the beef from Mount Alps.

295
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:56,910
You know how much I love beef.

296
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,620
Don't you?

297
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,560
Not now. Yi.

298
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,310
Not now, then when?

299
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,590
Next life.

300
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:42,620
[2024]

301
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,970
Get engaged first.

302
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,050
Take good care of him, Yi.

303
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,530
We're a family now.

304
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,400
Congratulations.

305
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,180
Why don't you let them get married?

306
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,830
It can only end then.

307
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,860
Don't worry, Uncle.

308
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,860
Diao and I are just engaged,

309
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,160
but he's my life partner anyway.

310
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,320
I'm just waiting for the day we can get married legally.

311
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,460
By then,

312
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,780
we'll get married like other heterosexual couples.

313
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,970
But why doesn't your friend, the owner of Kylin Drinks,

314
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,150
care?

315
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,930
Uncle, everyone is different.

316
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,400
Even if we are friends,

317
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,520
we choose different paths in life.

318
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,720
Anyway,

319
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,410
don't abandon my son.

320
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:21,270
Dad.

321
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,470
Don't worry too much, Mr. Sutha.

322
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,010
I've always been

323
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,170
teaching my son to be a man

324
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,090
who keeps his promises.

325
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,280
The children of our family will follow our promises.

326
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,460
You can trust our morality on this.

327
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,680
Congratulations.

328
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,080
Diao.

329
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,660
Yi.

330
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,600
Thank you. Auntie.

331
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,390
Don't call me Auntie. Call me Mom.

332
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:00,940
You too.

333
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,800
Please take care of Tem and Tam.

334
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,040
We'll be a family soon.

335
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:09,970
Yes.

336
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,810
This is a gift for my new son.

337
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,360
But I can't drive.

338
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,160
Practice. Driving is not harder than Taekwondo.

339
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,780
Go ahead and start the engine.

340
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,500
Thank you.

341
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,240
Go help him.

342
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,880
When will you get married?

343
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,880
The law has approved it.

344
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,300
Is that why you called us here?

345
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,080
Yes.

346
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,020
Or do you think I'll make a will?

347
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,020
Unfortunately,

348
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,090
I'll live a long life.

349
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,850
I haven't said anything yet.

350
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,480
I know what you're thinking.

351
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,350
Right, Diao?

352
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,530
You don't have to try to win Diao over.

353
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,440
I didn't.

354
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,440
I'm with Diao.

355
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:37,710
Diao.

356
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,350
Tell me if he bullies you.

357
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,190
I'll teach him a lesson. Do you understand, kid?

358
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,850
Okay.

359
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,920
What do you think? When are you getting married?

360
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,230
The auspicious time the master predicted has passed.

361
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,880
We'll get married soon.

362
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,510
I've done a lot lately.

363
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,550
I just formed a formula team.

364
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,820
If you want to get married, get married quickly.

365
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,650
If Diao changes his mind, you'll be sad.

366
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:08,800
Okay.

367
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,100
Dad, let go of me. My arm will break soon.

368
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,100
What do you think? Are you getting married or not?

369
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,970
Yes, I am.

370
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,760
That's it.

371
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,670
I've solved it for you. Don't worry.

372
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,450
Yes, Dad. I'm not worried at all.

373
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,010
Let's go eat.

374
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,290
Do you want some? There are so many snacks.

375
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,290
Diao.

376
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,200
What's wrong? Tell me.

377
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,810
Did you have fun working in South Korea?

378
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,180
It was fun.

379
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,440
If you have time, try traveling.

380
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,360
You weren't with him.

381
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,740
Didn't you miss him?

382
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,250
I did miss him.

383
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,090
We've been married for over two years. I still miss him.

384
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,320
When we met...

385
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,920
Kuea.

386
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,920
I have a very depressed thing.

387
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,190
But don’t tell others if I tell you.

388
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,710
Not even Lian.

389
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,550
Okay.

390
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,660
Since your wedding,

391
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,550
he and I haven't...

392
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,920
Really?

393
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,140
Why?

394
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,540
Don't you like it? You don't want to do it?

395
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,920
Or does he have an infarction disorder?

396
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,430
No, that's not it.

397
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,370
I was shy. That's why I rejected him several times.

398
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,060
And since we got engaged,

399
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,670
he didn't come home to sleep regularly.

400
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,520
Where did he sleep?

401
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,900
In the apartment.

402
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,480
But I think

403
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,870
he has his reason.

404
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,030
But...

405
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,310
Not at all?

406
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,870
That's why I wanted to ask you.

407
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,640
Did he become like this

408
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,560
because he doesn't love me anymore?

409
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,160
Don't think too much.

410
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,200
No matter what, he loves you.

411
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,840
How could he not love you?

412
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,030
How about this?

413
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,480
If you feel depressed, you can move out.

414
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,340
Come to my place.

415
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,680
But I think

416
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,070
you should talk to him first

417
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,400
and figure out how he feels now.

418
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,460
I dare not.

419
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,070
I'm afraid of his answer.

420
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,410
If he says he doesn't love me anymore,

421
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,450
and he was with me to keep his promise to my dad,

422
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,520
what should I do then?

423
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,970
I've never had Plan B in my life.

424
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,640
I just wanted to marry him.

425
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,380
If he didn't want to get married,

426
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,300
it would be worse if he did.

427
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,160
What should I do?

428
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:27,980
You...

429
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,700
Your life is yours no matter what.

430
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,530
Yi and your dad are not the masters of your life.

431
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,750
You need to find a way to live a happy life on your own.

432
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,290
I want to be reborn as a cow in the Alps.

433
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,520
Don't say that. Let's finish this lifetime first.

434
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,990
You're a great person.

435
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,160
You're capable.

436
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,420
You're good at studying

437
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,950
and Taekwondo.

438
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,110
There must be something

439
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,380
that can make you happy.

440
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:23,440
I want to find my way in this world like you.

441
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,780
But sometimes I feel sad for my mom.

442
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,480
Why did she give me a name that means 'alone'?

443
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,760
Mom left.

444
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,760
Dad got remarried.

445
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,870
I'm just like my name, right?

446
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,500
I would live alone,

447
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,910
and feel lonely.

448
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,630
You still have me.

449
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,290
Yes.

450
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,660
Thank you.

451
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,100
I feel much better.

452
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,820
[There's news that Yi and a woman are in the exhibition hall.]
[Be prepared.]

453
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:10,580
[Sending the photo]

454
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,850
Thank you. I love this car.

455
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,790
Since it's yours now, drive safely.

456
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,330
Okay, I promise.

457
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,580
Don't drive fast.

458
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:49,720
Please.

459
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,540
Yi.

460
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,480
Diao.

461
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,880
What are you doing here?

462
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,200
Hello, Tacha. I...

463
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,480
How could you do that?

464
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:01,560
What did I do?

465
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,310
That's why, right?

466
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,050
Okay.

467
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,300
I see.

468
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,310
Yi, what happened?

469
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,310
I just had a nightmare.

470
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,200
It's just a nightmare.

471
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,200
It's okay, Diao.

472
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,870
It's just a nightmare.

473
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,890
Just a nightmare.

474
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,750
It's just a nightmare.

475
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,370
Just a nightmare.

476
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,290
Hello. What's up, Kuea?

477
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,920
I'm ready to board.

478
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:34,920
You...

479
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,400
Calm down.

480
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,500
Listen to me first.

481
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,060
Yi had a car accident.

482
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,480
He was going to find you at the airport.

483
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:51,950
But the car broke down.

484
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,300
[An hour ago]

485
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,040
Look at this. Is it cute?

486
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,810
It's the cutest.

487
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,290
Lian.

488
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,620
Hello, Yi.

489
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,390
Do you know where Diao is now?

490
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,540
Where did you hide him?

491
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,870
What?

492
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,670
I don't know what you're talking about.

493
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,850
Don't lie to me. Diao's stuff is gone.

494
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:45,980
Where is the secret room?

495
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,240
Where is the secret room?

496
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,390
I'm at Lian's house.

497
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,650
I've never been to the secret room. And...

498
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,640
If I tell you where the secret room is, it won't be a secret.

499
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,420
Kuea, don't mess with me.

500
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,820
I really don’t know.

501
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,890
You can ask Lian if you don't believe me.

502
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,930
I'm with him all day today.

503
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,290
You must know.

504
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,890
He will discuss it with you no matter what.

505
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:14,380
What are you planning?

506
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,330
Found him, Boss.

507
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,710
Mr. Narcha bought a flight to Switzerland.

508

He's on board now.

509
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,030

510
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:30,300
Okay.

511
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,600
Yi.

512
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,600
Yi!

513
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:00,900
Lian.

514
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,040
I think Yi...

515
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:15,390
He is being taken to the hospital.

516
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,050
But he's still in a coma.

517
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:38,320
Why?

518
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,340
Why did this happen?

519
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,450
It's all my fault.

520
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,360
It's all my fault.

521
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,170
It's all my fault.

522
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,170
Yi.

523
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,790
Yi.

524
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,110
Diao is here.

525
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,670
Diao, you can't go in.

526
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:06,270
Calm down.

527
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,080
With the doctors here, he will wake up.

528
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:18,710
Dad.

529
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,200
I'm sorry.

530
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,870
It's all because of me

531
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,280
that Yi had the accident.

532
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:31,290
You didn't do anything wrong. Don't say sorry.

533
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,530
But if you think you're wrong,

534
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,280
stay with us for now. Don't go to Switzerland.

535
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,620
Let's talk

536
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,780
after he recovers.

537
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,020
Don't run away now.

538
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,090
If you want to leave then,

539
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,030
but he won't let you go,

540
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,350
I'll take care of it.

541
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,100
Ensure everyone's safety.

542
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,800
I don't think this is an ordinary accident.

543
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,790
We can't let this leak out.

544
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:12,870
Yes, Sir.

545
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,040
Dad.

546
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,890
He just took medicine. He's resting.

547
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,290
Fortunately, the security system of this car is good,

548
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,020
so Yi is not badly injured.

549
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,760
Can I go to see him?

550
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,840
I'm afraid he won't see us when he wakes up.

551
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,150
Okay.

552
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,970
If he wakes up and sees you not going to Switzerland, he will be very happy.

553
00:43:57,990 --> 00:43:58,740
Please take good care of him.

554
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,230
Yes, Dad.

555
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,120
Guard well.

556
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,250
If he wakes up, don't let him go anywhere else.

557
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:27,720
Yi.

558
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,460
Are you awake?

559
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:32,990
Who are you?

560
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:34,420
Yi.

561
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:35,960
I'm sorry.

562
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,240
It's all my fault.

563
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:39,660
Who are you?

564
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,690
Yi, I'm Diao.

565
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,460
Well...

566
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,600
You're the only one here. There's no one else.

567
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:50,880
I'm Tacha Wongteerawit.

568
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:53,700
Tacha is just a seven-year-old kid.

569
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,650
Don't tease me.

570
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,610
I'm not joking.

571
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:02,640
Does it hurt?

572
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:11,340
Go get my dad and the others.

573
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,810
You can leave now.

574
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:22,970
You don't remember me?

575
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,000
Or

576
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,300
have you lost your memory?

577
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:45,620
Get out.

578
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,920
How can you talk to your friend politely when you lose your memory?

579
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:23,460
Are we close?

580
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,860
You don't even remember me?

581
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,170
-Can't you remember?
-You're so annoying.

582
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:28,050
Stop joking.

583
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:28,950
This is Diao,

584
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:31,070
your fiancee. Why can't you remember him?

585
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,810
I feel so sorry for Yi.

586
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,550
He can't even remember me.

587
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,960
I don't know if he can recover his memory.

588
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:40,750
-Mr. Gun.
-Young Master Diao is missing.

589
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,610
Mr. Tacha bought a ticket to Switzerland.

590
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,490
Diao.
