00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,560
The Chen family has paid too much
for the Wongteerawits, Dad.

4
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,960
Hia deserves my protection, too.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,680
The easiest way to crash the wedding is...

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,040
for me to run away.

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,840
Your plan will succeed

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,440
only if you can get away from my people.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,080
In order for his plan to succeed,
I must pretend I know nothing about it.

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,880
Don't make any mistakes.

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,570
Someone has been stalking me
for a while now.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,760
It took a while
until they lost track of me.

13
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,440
You should hire
more security guards here, Dad.

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,560
I might not be the only one
they're stalking.

15
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,790
Tem wouldn't do that.

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,040
They're siblings.

17
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,080
No matter why or who,

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,680
even if that person is
Nong Diao's biological father,

19
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,120
I will not let Nong Diao hurt again.

I want you to meet someone first.

- Oh! Hia...
- Hia.

40
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,550
Nong Diao, this is Ing-ing Chatchada,

41
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,829
and this is Aun-aun Chatchanok.
They're my sisters.

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,550
And the most gorgeous lady
sitting here, smiling, is...

43
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,070
- Your mom?
- Right.

44
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,829
Hello, Mom.

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,620
Come take a seat, dear.

46
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,630
- Come on.
- Okay.

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,310
Welcome to our family, dear.

48
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,750
I didn't go out to greet you
because my feet hurt.

49
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,470
Also, Yi didn't tell me
he would take you to meet me now.

50
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,310
It's totally fine, Mom.

51
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,470
I'm the one who should be apologizing

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,270
- for misunderstanding you.
- What misunderstanding?

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,910
- Well...
- Well, Nong Diao...

54
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,870
thought that these girls
were my mistresses.

55
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,790
I didn't know you had sisters.

56
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,590
And... you two are absolutely stunning.

57
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,950
It's fine. We're not mad at you.

58
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,750
Actually, I'm older than you.

59
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,750
And Aun-aun is one year younger, right?

60
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,030
Right.

61
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,590
We were so worried

62
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:51,670
that we were the source of your argument.

63
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,829
But now, seeing you two getting married...

64
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,390
makes me blissful.

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,670
You two are the perfect match.

66
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,790
Diao, all 4 Chats are here today.

67
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,990
Chatchai, Chatdecha,

68
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,630
Chatchada, and Chatchanok.

69
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,790
You may rest assured now.

70
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,630
I can assure you that
he's not having an affair with anyone.

71
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,350
He's madly in love with you.

72
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,630
He also told me a lot of things about you.

73
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,470
So, from now on,

74
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,630
we're not strangers.

75
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,630
Okay.

76
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,070
Please bear with my son, dear.

77
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,630
He's stubborn, in denial,

78
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,909
grumpy, and cranky.

79
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,750
Mom,

80
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,030
that's enough.

81
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,550
That's not because of you.

82
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,950
- Neither of us is like that.
- Right.

83
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,630
It's probably inherited from his father.

84
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,710
Hia, from now on,

85
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,830
bring Kon Diao to meet us often.

86
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,430
I want a lovely brother.

87
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,230
I'm getting tired of a cruel brother.

88
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,870
I'm also happy...

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,310
to have an older sister

90
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,750
- and a younger sister...
- No!

91
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,630
Don't look at them.
Don't be lured by these girls.

92
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,710
You can only look at me.

93
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,190
Jeez, he's so possessive.

94
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,070
You've been like this since you were young,
and it hasn't changed at all.

95
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,590
Kon Diao is not one of your dolls, Hia.

96
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,830
Exactly.

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,870
I don't play with dolls.

98
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,030
That's enough of you.

99
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,470
When you guys meet, you always fight.

100
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,190
Anyway, bring him to see me often.

101
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,230
We're family now.

102
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,030
Nong Diao,

103
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,470
although your name means "alone,"
you are no longer alone.

104
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,510
- Can I have a hug?
- Yes.

105
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,590
- Come on.
- Let's hug.

106
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,670
Show some love.

107
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,630
What was it like meeting my mom?

108
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,510
She's gorgeous.

109
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,909
She's also very kind.

110
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,590
While she was hugging me,

111
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,470
I almost cried.

112
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,470
Why would you cry?

113
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:46,150
I missed my mom.

114
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,630
I'm not sure how it would be
if she were still alive.

115
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,550
She would love you

116
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,670
and be so proud of you.

117
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,910
Why would she be proud?

118
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,150
I'm not good at anything.

119
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,830
Who told you that?

120
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,990
You're a good person.

121
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,470
You excel in studies

122
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,390
and a tough sport like Taekwondo.

123
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,070
You're a good friend.

124
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,710
You're both a dad and a mom
to that bulging-eyed dog.

125
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,150
How come you're not good at anything?

126
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,390
I'm very proud that I'll get to marry you.

127
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,190
What are you doing?

128
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,990
Why did you close the elevator?

129
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,470
Will you actually run away
from our wedding?

130
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,710
We've talked about this, Hia.

131
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,670
Are you sure you're doing this?

132
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,230
Don't you trust me?

133
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,790
It's not like that.

134
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,070
I just want you to reconsider it.

135
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,310
I've made up my mind,

136
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,310
and I'm not going to change it.

137
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,790
Then, can you tell me
what you're planning to do?

138
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,150
My plan is to...

139
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,110
keep you in the dark.

140
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,630
Nong Diao! You have gone too far!

141
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,909
I won't pull my punches then!

142
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,260

143
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,110

+20+19

146
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,540
Swap the numbers

147
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,220
P.S. Swap them
and then enter the actual result!

148
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,590
Why would you have to
make it so complicated, Kuea?

149
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,270
Can you tell us...

150
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,470
how you two met?

151
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,910
I can't. Too lazy.

152
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:41,930
It's a long story.

153
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,140
Uh...

154
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,630
What's your first impression of Mr. Tacha?

155
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,870
Pretty cute. I wanted to tease him.

156
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,030
And when did you realize
you were falling in love with him?

157
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,870
No idea. Can't recall.

158
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,660
If I take it off and place it here,
it'll for sure be stolen.

159
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,790
I'll find a way to get it back later.

160
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:16,330
Aon!

161
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,990
Please end the interview right now.

162
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,470
Why?

163
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,350
Mr. Phayak has an urgent task.

164
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,310
But we just started the interview.

165
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,150
- If it's not finished...
- We'll inform you when we're ready.

166
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,150
Please.

167
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:44,990
Are you all set?

168
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,110
A mission to betray my Chihuahua

169
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,640
has now begun!

170
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,640
Diao,

171
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,000
Hia Yi's guards are now at every exit.

172
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,080
You have to be very careful.

173
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,920
Get to the front of the hotel.

174
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,560
Find Nuea and Sil.

175
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,400
They'll get you a cab,

176
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,720
and he'll take you to my secret house.

177
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,680
What about Makorn's guards?

178
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,480
You don't have to worry about that.

179
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,240
Those engineering grads
and their acting skills won't fail you.

180
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
Stick to the plan, Sil.

181
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,720
What happened?

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,890
- Over there!
- Where?

183
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,440
There!
There's someone suspicious over there!

184
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,200
Right!

185
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,400
Wait, no!

186
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,960
There is!

187
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,160
There isn't!

188
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,680
- What do you mean exactly?
- There's really someone there!

189
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,760
It's terrifying!

190
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,000
See? My friend is too scared to speak!

191
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,600
- No.
- He is!

192
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,640
Don't be scared.

193
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,960
It's fine if he's still there.

194
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,580
- Go get him!
- There's someone suspicious.

195
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,280
Let's take a look.

196
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,120
Hurry!

197
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,600
I undertake the precept...

198
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,040
- to refrain from incorrect speech.
- To refrain from incorrect speech.

199
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,680
- Amen.
- Amen...

200
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,400
What if I get caught?

201
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,120
Congratulations, then.

202
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,720
I don't want that.

203
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,200
Sorry.

204
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,600
I got carried away enjoying the performance
of those engineering grads in the lobby.

205
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,000
Did you just say "got carried away"?

206
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,560
Was Hia Yi in the lobby?

207
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,560
Um... I didn't see him.

208
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
Don't waste our time.

209
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,640
In, come with me.

210
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,520
Change your outfit.

211
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,520
- Do I have to?
- Yes!

212
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,880
Just change it and do nothing.

213
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,560
Be on standby.

214
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:27,920
As for you, Diao,

215
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,840
give me the keycard.

216
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,880
Oh, right. Here.

217
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,640
If you want anything, just tell us.

218
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,720
In and I will be on standby.

219
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,600
I wish you good luck.

220
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:48,830
Come on!

221
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,240
1, 2, 3!

222
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,680
Yeah!!

223
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,680
Kuea, can we swap roles?

224
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,040
You should play as Kon Diao.

225
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,560
You went to acting classes, didn't you?

226
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,320
That's impossible.

227
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,720
They'll recognize me once they see my face.

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Keep in mind that

229
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
I am Kirin!

230
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,970
♫Hey, you cutie!♫

231
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,200
Jeez, what a superstar!

232
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,770
We're the production team,

233
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,050
and we've come to photograph
and interview Mr. Tacha.

234
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,440
Why are you here, Mr. Kirin?

235
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,960
I'm one of Kon Diao's groomsmen.

236
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,880
That's awesome!

237
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,320
In that case,
after we finish interviewing Mr. Tacha,

238
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,080
may we please interview you?

239
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,710
Sure.

240
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,200
You can me interview first.

241
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,600
Kon Diao's not feeling very well.

242
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,200
Alright.

243
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,680
So... Shall we start?

244
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,000
It was just a group of ill-wishers
attempting to incite a disturbance.

245
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,640
However, the higher-ups demanded that

246
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,480
we not make any mistakes this time.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,360
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

248
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,560
Kon Diao just walked past me.

249
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,040
Why didn't you stop him?

250
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,160
If I did, it wouldn't be fun.

251
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,560
It would be too easy.

252
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,760
I want to see more of your efforts, Yi.

253
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,840
Jeez, this asshole!

254
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,680
Where are you now?

255
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,680
At a restaurant.

256
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,520
What will you do, Yi?

257
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,760
There's only 12 minutes left.

258
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,120
I'll get even with you later.

259
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,880
Although it's highly competitive in Korea,

260
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,840
it's a lot of fun.

261
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,400
And... what about...

262
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,119
Oh, Kon Diao...

263
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,880
You fell asleep.

264
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,920
He must be exhausted.

265
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,440
He didn't get much sleep last night.

266
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,640
I don't think he can give an interview.

267
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,440
I'll inform you right away once he's ready.

268
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,960
Well, okay.

269
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,800
Thank you so much, Mr. Kirin.

270
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,680
Then, please excuse us.

271
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,630
Yes.

272
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,280
Thank you.

273
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,360
Hey! How did you get in here?

274
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,040
You don't have a keycard, do you?

275
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,680
Hey! You can't be in here!
It's a private room!

276
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,360
- Mr. Tacha.
- Stop!

277
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,000
Mr. Tacha's not in the room, sir.

278
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,880
Come on.

279
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,880
What should we do?

280
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,560
I think it's time to implement Plan C.

281
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,000
Hello, Kuea. What's next?

282
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,600
Kuea, hello?

283
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,800
Why is it broken now?

284
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,520
Kon Diao!

285
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,360
- Kon Diao!
- Winner?

286
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,680
- Plan C.
- Plan C?

287
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,440
Not B?

288
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,400
It must be C now.

289
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,560
We've found Sathaporn, sir.

290
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,090
Where?

291
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,440
He was fleeing the country
through natural routes.

292
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,080
Our people are taking him back here, sir.

293
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,440
Handle him

294
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,400
the way Yi wants.

295
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,760
Yes, sir.

296
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:13,880
Where's Kon Diao?

297
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,320
We haven't found him, sir.

298
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,720
I'll give you 10 minutes.

299
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,960
If Kon Diao doesn't show up,

300
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,360
I'll cancel the wedding.

301
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,360
Okay.

302
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,760
You understand what that means, right?

303
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,680
If the wedding is canceled

304
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,800
and the Wongteerawit family is at fault,

305
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,640
I will be held accountable
per the contract.

306
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,720
The Wongteerawit family's ownership
of the racing track land

307
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,000
will belong to the Chen family.

308
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,280
But sir...

309
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,360
A deal is a deal.

310
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,840
If you took the land,

311
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,760
we wouldn't have anything left.

312
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Come on, Mr. Sattha.
Can't you figure it out yet?

313
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,400
Everything that went down

314
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,440
was due to your selfishness.

315
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,080
You've been using Kon Diao
as a bargaining chip

316
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,320
to take advantage of us for too long.

317
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,040
I love Kon Diao.

318
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,440
I've never thought to do that to my son.

319
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,600
Suit yourself.

320
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,240
Find him, then.

321
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,880
As for Tem,

322
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,400
I'll have to report him to the police.

323
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,600
Please, sir.

324
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,240
Please forgive my son.

325
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,440
He's just a child.

326
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,360
He knows nothing.

327
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,200
Do you now realize the anguish of a father
who has been blackmailed?

328
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,440
Hi, there.

329
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,200
Hello. Hi.

330
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,880
Whoa! Hi.

331
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,200
- Enough, babe.
- What?

332
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,040
That's enough.

333
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,760
- We have to greet everyone, babe.
- That's enough.

334
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,400
Well, their wedding is
actually smaller than ours.

335
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,120
The wedding's small, but the problem's big.

336
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,360
What do you mean?

337
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,520
Kon Diao ran away.

338
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,520
What?!

339
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,040
She's laughing.

340
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,040
So funny.

341
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,560
- Smile. Come on, smile.
- Love it.

342
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,360
Uh... I'm in the lobby.

343
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,120
Right. You can turn there.

344
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,480
Thank you.

345
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,280
Winner.

346
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,960
Go to the lobby now.

347
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,200
Sil and Nuea are waiting.

348
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,360
Congratulations! You can do it!

349
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,120
Come on, hurry up.

350
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,920
Just go. Bye-bye!

351
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,200
Go! Bye-bye.

352
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,640
Mr. Tacha!

353
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,120
Wait, sir!

354
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,800
By and large,
it's all your fault, Mr. Sattha.

355
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,920
I apologize, sir.

356
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,120
What I've done is wrong.

357
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,680
I'm a crook.

358
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,280
Please accept my apologies

359
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:23,800
and penalize me.

360
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,760
Please don't do anything to Tem.

361
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,000
When will you stop cleaning up
after your son?

362
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,040
You've been raising your children
wrong all along.

363
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,800
You've spoiled them too much.

364
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm talking about your daughter as well.

365
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,400
As for Tem and Sathaporn,

366
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:49,220
I'll have to report the case to the police

367
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,690
and let it be prosecuted
according to the law.

368
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,800
And please let this be the last time.

369
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,180
After this,
the Chen family and the Wongteerawits

370
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,560
will no longer be under any obligation.

371
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
Do you understand, Mr. Sattha?

372
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,360
Sir...

373
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,120
our people have found Mr. Tacha.

374
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,080
It seems like
Kon Diao just saved you again.

375
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,400
Still, I want to hear from Kon Diao

376
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,720
if he still wants to marry Yi.

377
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,680
If he doesn't want to, let him.

378
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,880
You have no right to make him do anything.

379
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,080
Understood?

380
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,240
Sir, please wait. My friend's coming.

381
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,400
- Okay. Sure.
- Okay.

382
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,440
[Kuea: Plan's changed!!!]

383
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Uh, excuse me.

384
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Do you want to make merit with me?

385
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,320
- Is that for a donation?
- Yes.

386
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,280
Sil! Wrong timing.

387
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,200
But it's over now.

388
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,080
Kuea just texted me
that the plan's changed.

389
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,720
What's our plan now?

390
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,920
I'm absolutely lost.

391
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,000
It's Plan... W.

392
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,200
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.

393
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,240
Here's for your wait.

394
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,680
Here's my donation.

395
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:42,680
Sil.

396
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,520
It's his.

397
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,440
It'll create positive karma for
Hia Yi and Kon Diao.

398
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,120
Sil, this is a wedding.

399
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,800
Their love will last a long time.

400
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,840
Fine. Come on. Let's go.

401
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,840
What's next, Kuea?

402
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,880
Hello? Hello!

403
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,400
2 minutes left.

404
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,200
Gotcha!

405
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,920
Hia!

406
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,240
Come on now. Stop playing.

407
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,520
Let's go inside.

408
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,970
No, I won't.

409
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm about to be free.

410
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,560
If you're worried about your family,

411
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,280
just go inside and see for yourself.

412
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,200
Come with me.

413
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,720
No. If you want me to go with you,

414
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,360
you have to win me first.

415
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,160
Are you being stubborn?

416
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,680
I'm not.

417
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,960
You are.

418
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,600
You think you're going to win?

419
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,120
I'm not going to pull my punches,
Mr. Phayak Chen.

420
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,760
You'd better keep your guard up then,
Tacha Chen.

421
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,760
I haven't yet agreed to change my surname.

422
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:04,960
Dad!

423
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,560
- Ouch!
- Gotcha!

424
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,240
Fine! You want me to go all out, don't you?

425
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,840
Stop!

426
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,520
I'll handle it.

427
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,540
Nong, how did you get here?

428
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,940
Who took you here?

429
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,220
How did you end up here?

430
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,570
Nong Diao.

431
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,820
I told you.

432
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,580
No matter how many times you run away,

433
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,020
I will always bring you back.

434
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,820
Your time to be stubborn is over, honey.

435
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,860
I will not let you run away from me
ever again.

436
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,380
Please stay with me

437
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,900
and let me love you.

438
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,900
I will never let you down.

439
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,140
What if I'm stubborn?

440
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,660
I will still love you.

441
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,420
What if I'm naughty?

442
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,700
It won't change.

443
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,860
No matter if you're one of
the Wongteerawits or the Chens,

444
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,180
I will always love you, Kon Diao,

445
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,620
and my love for you will last forever.

446
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,650
Will you marry me?

447
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,210
Kiss him! Kiss him!

448
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,170
Kiss him! Kiss him!!

449
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,200
Kiss him!! Kiss him!!!

450
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,090
Kiss him!!! Kiss him!!!!

451
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,170
Congrats, Diao.

452
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,970
Thank you so much, Kuea.

453
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,120
Thank you for giving me life,

454
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,100
a life in which I met Hia
and became a part of his life.

455
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,180
I'm grateful for everything
you've done for me.

456
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,720
However, from now on,

457
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,540
I will no longer be one
of the Wongteerawits.

458
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,540
Even so, you'll always have my respect.

459
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,720
Regarding the remaining land
of the racing track

460
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,770
owned by the Wongteerawit family,

461
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,420
I will ask Makorn to buy it
at a reasonable price.

462
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:39,170
This will be the last thing
I can do for you.

463
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,300
Please stop any further attempts.

464
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,260
From now on,

465
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,980
I hope you'll be happy, Dad.

466
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,140
Kon Diao,

467
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,340
I'm sorry.

468
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,780
I sincerely apologize.

469
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,180
I...

470
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,100
I don't deserve a wonderful son like you.

471
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,180
I love you, Kon Diao.

472
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,300
I love you too, Dad.

473
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,860
Kiss!

474
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,220
Kiss!!

475
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,910
Kiss him! Kiss!

476
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:11,020
Kiss him! Kiss him!!

477
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,180
Kiss him!! Kiss him!!

478
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,060
Do it, sir!

479
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,020
Kiss him!

480
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,920
Where's my reward?

481
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,900
What reward?

482
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,680
You didn't win, Hia.

483
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,130
Kon Diao won because the time ran out.

484
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:44,550
Is that so?

485
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,050
The time ran out...

486
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,610
after Yi hugged Kon Diao.

487
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,540
It's a draw, then.

488
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,880
Love wins.

489
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,630
Love always wins.

490
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,700
I'm tired.

491
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,800
Of course, you are.
You spent that much energy running away.

492
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,800
Are you tired?

493
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,240
No.

494
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,960
I can play tag with you hundreds more times

495
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,420
if, in the end, you'll marry me.

496
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,970
Thank you so much for today,
bulging-eyed doggo.

497
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,280
You did a great job.

498
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,420
I shall appoint you
as the Chen family's spy from now on.

499
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,550
Your full name will be...

500
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,250
Natasha Romanong Woof-woof Chen.

501
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:33,040
What?

502
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:35,230
Was she your accomplice?

503
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,070
When did you talk about this?

504
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,000
Cheater!

505
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,700
Just know that
I've reconciled with Nong now.

506
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:54,190
I mean, Natasha Romanong.

507
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,290
From now on, don't make fun of me

508
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,870
by saying that I'd eat her, okay?

509
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,410
Fine.

510
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,150
The only Nong I'll eat out...

511
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:16,890
is you, Nong Diao.

512
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,630
Hold on, Hia.

513
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,150
Nong, you have to leave now.

514
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,380
I'm sorry, Nong,

515
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,360
but this scene is not for children.

516
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:39,980
Are you ready?

517
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,580
Eat up,

518
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,950
Diao, my beloved son.

519
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,090
- Okay, Dad.
- Mm.

520
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:24,330
How come he's your beloved son?

521
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:25,770
What about me?

522
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,150
You've already fallen off the radar.
Have you figured it out yet?

523
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:35,680
Just admit it, Dad.

524
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,840
I'm just a gardener's son, right?

525
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,190
You just adopted me, didn't you?

526
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,050
That's nonsense.

527
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:46,680
If you were not my son,
I wouldn't let Kon Diao marry you.

528
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:50,310
Fine, then.

529
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,910
- Right, Diao...
- Yes?

530
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,600
Why don't you bring Nong here as well?

531
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,030
I've prepared a room for her.

532
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:58,590
It's very cute and lovely.

533
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:00,710
I'll show you the room.

534
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:02,470
Really, Dad?

535
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,310
I don't want to bother you, though.

536
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,240
Wait, what did I miss?

537
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:10,080
Am I being kept out of the loop?

538
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:13,390
Did you make a room
for that bulging-eyed dog?

539
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,940
You guys have gone too far.

540
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:18,040
That bulging-eyed dog's
forgotten her roots, hasn't she?

541
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,180
What a cocky dog!

542
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,450
- Why would you swear at her?
- What?

543
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:22,750
What a foul-mouthed person you are!

544
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,540
- Diao.
- Yes?

545
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,050
Do you want a new husband?
I'll get you one.

546
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:29,150
Really, Dad?

547
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:31,120
I'm thinking of finding one, too.

548
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,080
You can't, Dad!

549
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,490
You're so good at taking jokes, huh?

550
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,500
You're married, Mr. Tacha.

551
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:38,750
You're not single anymore.

552
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:42,570
What about a celebrity, Diao?

553
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,060
- I know a lot of them.
- That sounds great, Dad.

554
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,650
[2029]

555
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,720
We've been married for three years,

556
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:14,360
yet it feels like yesterday.

557
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,600
I'm shy to admit it.

558
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,440
It may sound like I'm bragging,
but it's true that...

559
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,000
marrying Hia is the best decision
I've ever made.

560
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:32,440
Every day is a great day because of him.

561
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,910
Papa's here!

562
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,480
I'm home, dear.

563
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,440
You have balloons!

564
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,200
I was born with the name "Kon Diao,"
meaning "alone."

565
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:48,920
Here's your birthday gift.

566
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:53,600
I hoped to be a loving family
for someone one day,

567
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,320
but today, it exceeded my hopes.

568
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,480
Kon Diao, let's go.

569
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,220
Yes, Hia.

570
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,240
Not only Hia,

571
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:03,840
Wait up.

572
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,280
...but we do have Le Ling
as our lovely daughter now.

573
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,080
Come on. Let's go.

574
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,840
Ling-ling had been alone before.

575
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:29,070
But today,
she has both of us as her fathers.

576
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:33,200
♫Happy birthday to you♫

577
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:38,000
♫Happy birthday to you, Happy♫

578
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:39,440
And recently,

579
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,760
we just received
the most wonderful present,

580
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,640
Le Xi, our happiness and hope.

581
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,080
The Chen family line will be carried on.

582
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,040
There!

583
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,240
Don't look!

584
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,960
- I already did.
- No more looking, okay?

585
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:16,400
Don't look, okay?

586
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,430
Why can't we have a large family

587
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:26,060
when there's so much love
and happiness to go around?

588
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,840
I'm glad that
we can share love in our family.

589
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,440
We'll embrace this love
and care for one another as a family.

590
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,630
Hia,

591
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,520
we now have the rest of our lives
to spend together.

592
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,990
You will get to hold us,

593
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,000
and we will hold you forever and ever.

594
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,880
Your love inspires me
to be a better person.

595
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,310
Me too.

596
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,130
Papa, Daddy, ready?

597
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,440
- We are, honey.
- Come on, Ling-ling.

598
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,130
I hope that this can happen equally

599
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,840
everywhere in the world,

600
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,200
that we can feel happy
that we have been granted this right,

601
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,310
and that I, Kon Diao,

602
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,610
will never be alone again.

603
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,240
This is my home.
